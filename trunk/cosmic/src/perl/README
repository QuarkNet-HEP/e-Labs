GENERAL:
ThresholdTimes files (by convention we like to write $file.thresh) are NOT re-made
if the file already exists. (This is just like what a TR should do).

Remember to put your raw data, and detector numbers in quotes (space
delimited) if you want to use more than one file with ThresholdTimes.pl

Run ShowerArgs.pl/PerformanceArgs.pl with no arguments (or less than what is required)
to see what arguments are needed.

You will probably need to edit Plot.pl and point gnuplot to a gnuplot4 somewhere on the system
(on blacknuss it's at /home/peryshki/gnuplot-4.0.0)
You should point it to whatever gnuplot you have installed on your system.

the *.TR files are the VDL we have located at:

(login with super/guesswhat?)


Example perl call:
perl -w FluxArgs.pl DGJulyTest 180 OUT3

Example perl call:
perl ShowerArgs.pl "pulser_1-1-3.8hz pulser_1-1-3_2.8hz" "180 181" OUT
