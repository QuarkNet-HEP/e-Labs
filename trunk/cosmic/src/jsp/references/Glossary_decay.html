A process in which an original particle (or nucleus) disappears and is replaced by
two or more particles (called decay products.) <p> Decays conserve <i>energy</i>,
<i>charge</i> and <i>momentum</i>. The summed mass of the decay products is less
than the mass of the original. The vector sum of the decay products' momentum must
equal the momentum of the original particle. The summed charge of all decay products
must equal the charge of the original.
