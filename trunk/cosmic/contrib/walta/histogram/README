For these simple programs, it is easier to use the single
header file in the include directory.  It wraps the code
and methods into the single header file.

If I ever need to build a more complicated program, these
pieces here can be built into a .o or a library.

At that point, however, I probably want to use an implementation
of a heavy-duty histogram library from somewhere.
