A list of the command-line options to give to daq.exe
Most of the things listed below give the default values.
At the end are some examples.

Mandatory option. 

--name=filename    probably want to use something descriptive but brief
                   like onroof_20030627 or muon_20030627 
                   
Not mandatory, but useful

--num=0            you can restart at any filenumber you want.
                   daq.exe will then format the filenames:
                   filename_0000.log    filename_0000.txt


Other options that allow you fine control (none are required)

--loglevel=0       Whether to put any pre-analysis into a log file.
                   loglevel=1 turns on some singles rate calculations.
                   loglevel=2 echos more status information.
                   loglevel=3   reserved for future use.
                   loglevel=4 echos all data strings.
                   loglevel=5 turns on some ugly debug lines (none yet).

--coincidence=2    How many scintillator are required for coincidence.
                   daq.exe resets this at the beginning of the run.
                   

--events=5000      These two control when the the filenumber is incremented
--seconds=20000    and a new file is started.  This happens at the 
                   first coincidence following the earliest of these two.
                   

--singles_events=0      These control how frequently daq.exe queries the
--singles_seconds=60    card to reveal the singles rate.
                        These are mutually exclusive!  (Or both can be 0)
                        Turning on singles_events turns off singles_seconds.

--files=9999     With a high number, it will keep taking data forever.
                    Or maybe you want only one file's worth.  Or two.

--gatewidth=10    Set gate width between 1 and 2048 times 24ns.
--tmcdelay=6      Set tmc delay to this many clock ticks.
                  These two values are the hardware defaults.
                  For air showers, I have been using 150 and 50.

--baudrate=57600  Set baudrate to 19200 38400 57600 or 115000
                  Danger ! setting the wrong baudrate can lock up your
                  serial port.  See the README_BAUDRATE file for details.

--setuponly       Combine with --files=1 to run the setup then exit.

--nogps           Tell the DAQ program there is no GPS information in 
                  the data.  Default assumes valid GPS data.

--firmware        Inconsistently implemented.  Use with caution.
                  Toggles between firmware after 27 or 23 or before.
                  Default is firmware 32, from December 2004.

--safeds          Firmware version 23 has a bug that causes problems
                  if the DS command is given while the TMC is enables.
                  safeds carefully disables the TMC.  Give this on
                  the command line, or it will automatically be turned
                  on if you give --firmware=23.  Default os off.

Not implemented yet, but planned.

--datefile          Separately increment the datestring in the filename.
                    Useful if you set DAQ somewhere and walk away for weeks.

--pcdate            Will also query the PC to save what it thinks the 
                    date and time is.  Useful if you use the PC to read
                    out two things (like the lecroy scope).
                    
--comment="A comment of some sort"
                    Insert a comment into the log file for each run.

Examples:  (Type the things following the >)

> ./daq.exe --name=test_20030627 --num=12 --coincidence=3 --files=1

Will set the card to a coincicence of 3 channels, and take a single data
file and call it test_20030627_0012.txt and a log file 
test_20030627_0012.log


More complicated, but what I have been using recently (Summer 2003) for 
walta is this:

./daq.exe --gatewidth=150 --tmcdelay=50 --coincidence=2 --baudrate=38400 --seconds=5000 --name=uwphys_20030904 --loglevel=1 &
