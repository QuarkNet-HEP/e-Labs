Instructions on how to use daq.exe
Second half of this file describes "how it works".

The instructions here force you to check some common problems
before you try running the program.

Commands you type at the keyboard start with a >
For example, if I say to do this
> ls -a
you would type "ls -a" at the command prompt without the quotes or the > .
See the README_UNIXCOMMANDS for more details like so.
> cat README_UNIXCOMMANDS

Step 1:
Make sure the program is not already running.  
> ps -e | grep daq.exe
Look for the program daq.exe.  If it is not there, then it is not running.



Step 1a: (danger)
Maybe you want to stop the old process and start a new one.  I haven't 
programmed any proper interrupts, so you have to be mean.  When you
do the command in step one, make a note of the process id number, which is
the first number on the line (it is 9851 in the example below)

[waltadaq@lisa daq]$ ps -e | grep daq.exe
 9851 ?        00:00:00 daq.exe

Then, to kill it (be sure you really want to kill it!), type
> kill -KILL 9851



Step 2:
Look to see what filename you should give.
> ls log/
or
> ls log/ | tail
Look for the last one listed.  It should be called something like
onroof_20030627_0036.log or a similar pattern.
you want to note the onroof_20030125 and the 36 pieces of the pattern.
follow the old pattern, whatever it is, unless you specifically want to 
change it.



Step 3:
Now you can restart the data acquisition program.
  YOU MIGHT PREFER TO USE THE SCRIPT!
Use one after the previous number, and use the same title
The at command doesn't let you make corrections.
If you have typed everything correctly, start it with a ctrl-d
If you made a mistake, type ctrl-c to cancel and try again.

To use the script:
> at now
at> ./standardrun.sh 20040630 0
at> (type ctrl-d if you did it correctly)

Or type it in longhand:
> at now
at> ./daq.exe --name=onroof_20030627 --num=37
at> (type ctrl-d if you did it correctly)



Step 3a: (Danger)
Sometimes you are logged in at the terminal and you are testing.
Instead of running it in the background, you can run it live.
Try just typing ./daq.exe --name=test_20030125 --num=12



Step 4:
Make sure this is running.
> ls log/*
and see that the new file is there, called onroof20030125_0037.log 
> ps -e | grep daq.exe
and see that there is a daq.exe program running.


Step 5:
Put an entry in the captains.log 
saying what you did an why.
Cut and paste any e-mail correspondence might be informative.

Done.




How it works.

The program first sends in about 15 commands to set up the card correctly.
Then it reads stuff from the serial port.

After every read, it decides whether it is time to get the scalar reading
or start a new file.  This is based on what you told it, either some amount
of time, or some number of events.
