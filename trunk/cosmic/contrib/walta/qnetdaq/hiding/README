This contains the skeletons of code that you can use to unpack the QuarkNet 
DAQ card for analysis.  The examples newread and runsummary produce the 
simplest output:  a summary line for each event and a summary that includes
the singles rates (if your data file has some DS in it).

First:
compile using make.  (slightly non-standard, waiting for a fix):
make newread.exe
or
make runsummary.exe

Then run it
./newread.exe filename1 filename2 ...
or
./runsummary.exe filename1 filename2 ...

Second:
The newread.cc and runsummary.cc are examples of user programs to do something
useful.  Use them as a template.  Plese see the include/*.h for the programs
that actually do the heavy lifting.


Important information:

These really are just skeletons.  You can write code to generate what you want,
or leave it as it is and send the text output to your favorite ntuple 
manipulating program. 

There are many things that might be specific to how you take data.  

There are many things, especially in the qnetdaqcard.h that are simply not
implemented.  You are welcome to implement them and send me the revisions.

Good luck!
