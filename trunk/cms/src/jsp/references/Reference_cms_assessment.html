<b>Milestone: Review, explain and assess your results.</b><P>      <I>So you've produced some plots.  Can you makes sense of them: can you explain what they are telling you about the behavior of particles in the CMS detector?  Do they support an answer to your research question?  Is it an answer you expected?  (Why, or why not?) Are your results sufficient to support a conclusion?  Are there further studies you could run that would test your emerging conclusion? Discuss these questions first among your group members, and then with people outside of your group, until you are satisfied that you are ready to defend your conclusion publicly. </I>       <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../jsp/logEntry.jsp?keyword=cms_assessment',700,600)"><b>Log it!</b><IMG SRC="../graphics/logbook_pencil.gif" border="0"  align="middle"></A>  <P> <B>References</B>
