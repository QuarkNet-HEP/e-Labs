SETUP

  Test the template elab: 
  
  Check out the i2u2 from the CVS
  Deploy the template elab: ant deploy-template
 
 Generic Knowledge:
 
 Currently, we have chosen to have the VDS_HOME in /Users/tiberius/local/apache-tomcat-5.5.17/webapps/elab/template/output
 This means that the deployment copies there the VDS configuration files (sites.xml and tc.data), and that the workflow is there as well (analysis-wf.kml)
 There is a vds.home.template property in the /WEB-INF/elab.properties but is not used in the code (it's intended to replace the hardcoded path mentioned above)
 
 User tasks:
 1. create your workflow (let's call it UserAnalysis), compile it and put the files in template/src/vdl: cp UserAnalysis.dtm template/src/vdl
 2. create and customize the UserAnalysisWorkflow to allow the VDL2 engine to load and run your workflow
 3. create an input page (userAnalysisInput.jsp), similar to analysisInput.jsp
 4. create JSP that will process the request from the input page, similar to analysisProcess.jsp
 5. create a java bean UserAnalysisBean to hold the input from your inputFile, and pass it to the analysis page.
 6. add your build/deploy targets in the build.xml
 
 7. Test and Enjoy: go to localhost:8080/elab/template/userAnalysisInput.jsp
