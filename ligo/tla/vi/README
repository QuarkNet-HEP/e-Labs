tla/vi subdirectory
===================

Each of the directories here contains all that is needed to define
and implement a transformation for Bluestone.   See plot1chan for
what is probably the simplest example.

In case you were wondering, vi stands for "Virtual Instrument", and is
borrowed from National Instrument's very useful LabView tool.
