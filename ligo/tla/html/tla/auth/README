The sole purpose of this subdirectory is to trigger user
authentication via HTTP Basic Authentication (using the browser).
We save the credentials in the _SESSION and that is considered
enough proof of authentication on the rest of the site.

There must be a .htaccess file in this directory (or the equivalent
in the server configuration for this directory) to trigger the
authentication.
