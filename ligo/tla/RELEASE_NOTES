 	Bluestone  (or TLA = Tool, LIGO Analysis) -- RELEASE NOTES

This file contains a list of notable changes to Bluestone, the LIGO
Analysis Tool software, along with the dates when a particular version
is made the "Test" or "Production" release

For changes to particular files please see also the CVS check-in notes
for that particular file.

==Release Types==

There are three release levels for the software, so that we can
continue development while providing a stable platform for teachers
and students.  They are:

   * Production:  the best, most stable version we have to date.  This
	          is what teachers and students should be using, unless
	          specifically asked to test a new feature

   * Testing:     a version which we think works but which needs to be
	          tested further before it is considered ready for
	          general use.  This is a "release candidate".  This is
	          beta testing.  If major errors are not found then it
	          will likely become the Production release.

   * Development: stuff we are still working on, and it likely as not
		  does not yet work.  Only developers will want to use
		  this version.  This is alpha testing.  Once we have it
		  in a working form it may become a Testing release.


==Releases by Version==

This is a history of the Bluestone/TLA software releases, by version
number and date: 


== 0.74 ==
('testing' on 2 June 2009) 

   * Authorizing Bluestone to access your e-lab group also logs
     you in to the e-lab. 


== 0.73 ==
('testing' on 26 May 2009, production 26 May 2009)

   * Save e-lab group/password to database table when we know them

   * functionalize load_BOINC_util()

   * Revised masthead


== 0.72 ==

   * New tutorial transcluded from wiki pages

   * List links to transcluded content in the footer

   * Improved mechanisms for reaching a "final destination" next_url

== 0.71 ==

   * Adjust user levels of various channels
   
   * Add calibration info for ANL cluster machines 

   * Check for authorization but do no require it (default to Guest)

   * use TLA_ROOT_DIR not ROOT_DIR.

   * Functionalize internals of run_dmtroot.sh

   * Link to tutorial offered for beginners.

   * Glossary term pop-ups done with JavaScript


=== 0.70 ===
('testing' on 31 October 2008)

   * User can now specify minimum y value for a plot.

   * Implemented "Cancel" button on the task_execution page. 

   * Channel selector has a yellow/green status indicator, with green
     indicating a valid, selected channel, while yellow indicates a
     channel selection that is pending.

   * All plot options (max/min y, pen color) are reset whenever
     you press 'GO'. 

   * While a task is in progress an interesting question is posed
     to give the student something to think about while waiting.
 
   * Task parameter files now written correctly, so we now give a link
     to the parameter file (metadata) along with download links.

   * elab_login() says it needs you to authorize Bluestone to access
     your e-Lab group account, and the button says "Authorize" not
     login.   This makes the purpose of the request clearer; it's more
     like using a keychain than logging in.

   * Lists of channels moved up to etc/ subdirectory, out of html/tla.
     This is where all supporting files should live.

   * GDS-EARTHQUAKE channels moved to Advanced user level, since it
     might confuse new users that many earthquakes do not show up,
     and to introduce just PEM channels at Intermediate level.

   * PEM seismic channels default to .rms component, never mean, while
     DMT-BLRM default to .mean component,  never .rms.    We take
     square root of RMS channels in either case to always get microns/s.

   * Move mean/min/max trend components to Advanced level, to lessen
     confusion. 

   * Fixed how auto_update control is handled, including initialization.

   * Fixed problem where task_execution would continue indefinitely
     even after analysis had completed.


=== 0.62 ===
('testing' on 13 October 2008, production 17 Oct 2008)

   * Fix problem with task_execution iterating even after task
     completes successfully.  This seemed to happen only after an
     analysis completed and then you go back and modify parameters and
     run it again.

   * Do not show "Save As" button, since tekoa cannot make use of it.


=== 0.61 ===
('testing' on 5 August, 2008, production 9 Sept 2008)

   * Check for pecl_http functions before using them, and if not found
     (as is the case on tekoa) then fail more gracefully.


=== 0.60 ===
('testing' on 5 August, 2008)

   * Authentication to the e-Lab site now working.  This will be used
     to submit tasks to Swift and to save plots to the e-Lab site.

   * "Save Plot As" button works to save a plot to the e-Lab site.
      It asks for authentication to the e-Lab site if not already done.

   * After you jump to task_exectution page you wait until expected
     time of task completion, instead of refreshing every 5 seconds.
     If the task is not yet done, then refresh every 5 seconds until
     it finishes.

   * Glossary and Help links, which pop open a new window, use the
     'kiwki' skin to just show the text, no wiki controls, but with
     a "close window" button.
   
   * Seismometer units changed to "microns/s" as more understandable,
     (and avoids \\mum/s bug).

   * Fixed calibration bug where older DMT seismic channels without
     "BRMS" in the name were not being calibrated.   Also deal with
     negative BRMS values (these should not happen, but they exist).


=== 0.52 ===
('testing' on 17 July, 2008, production 18 July 2008)

   * Allow guest authentication based on referer domain name .i2u2.org
  
   * Provide 'default' authentication as 'guest', which short-circuits
     use of HTTP Basic Auth

   * Seismometer units changed to "microns/s" as more understandable,
     (and avoids \\mum/s bug).


=== 0.51 ===
('testing' on 18 June, 2008, 'production' on 11 July 2008)

   * Units are set for a channel (in ROOT, not the GUI code) and the
     proper calibration is applied (eg. for DMT channels take sqrt() )

   * If a task completes but with non-zero return code then stop in
     Task Execution step and display log files.

   * Return codes from task are translated into text error messages,
     both when task is launched and when it completes.

   * Detects changes between production/test/development release and 
     forces a reset.

   * view_log_files() function now works correctly both from main tla
     directory and from the slot.

   * Password file for guest acceses moved to ./conf/local.d/tla-passwd
     relative to the apache httpd ServerRoot


=== 0.50 ===
('testing' on 9 May 2008, production June 18 2008)

   * Added "Task Execution" step.  When an analysis is launched it
     immediately goes to this step, and then polls the server until
     the task is done, instead of the browser waiting.  This is also
     in preparation for managing Grid execution.

   * Found and fixed a problem with memory usage.  (The channel
     selector, which is large,  was taking twice as much space as necessary.)

   * Added execution selector to allow the user to select 'local'
     execution, and eventually 'Swift' or 'Pegasus', or 'tekoa' to use
     have a task run on tekoa from some other machine.  For testing we
     also have 'POST', to test the HTTP POST API.  Added a
     TaskExecution object to support this, in new file execution.php

   * Fixed a problem with finding the 'bin' directory for executable
     scripts, which was preventing the data_prep script from running
     for second-trends.

   * Added "Report a Bug" button to pop open a bug report form.

   * Next/Previous buttons are now in the control box with everything else.

   * Test and Development versions of the release show a warning to
     that effect in the message area.



=== 0.42 ===
('testing' on 12 December 2008, 'production' 9 May 2008)

   * At the beginner level the flow diagram boxes do not have links
     in them if the boxes are not green (have not yet been completed).

   * Reset button under a finished plot now says "New Session", which
     is a little clearer about that it does at that point.

   * At beginner level moving the mouse over the step blocks gives
     tooltip help. 

   * Show GMT time on data selection time, all user_levels. 
     Advanced users also get current GPS time.

   * Track memory usage.

   * Fixed problem with GDS-EARTHQUAKE channel being considered invalid.
     (Actually any GDS channel, but this is currently the only one.)

   * Internal changes to prepare for Grid execution, or general
     ability to launch, monitor, and kill tasks.

   * Fixed a problem with finding the 'bin' directory for executable
     scripts, which was preventing the data_prep script from running
     for second-trends. [Backport from v0.50]

   * Fixed a problem with memory usage.  (The channel selector, which
     is large,  was taking more space than necessary.) [Backport from v0.50] 



=== 0.41 ===
('testing' on 24 October 2007, 'production' 28 November 2007)

   * Allow authentication from co-located project Pirates@Home,
     to allow volunteers from that project to assist with beta
     testing.


=== 0.40 ===
('testing' on 2 October 2007)

   * All the little fixes required to get this to run on the I2U2
     cluster at Argonne National Laboratory.  This works at Argonne,
     Hanford, and Spy Hill.

   * Rearranged directory structure, so that supporting files are at
     the top, along with bin and root subdirectories.  Under this an
     html subdirectory containing tla (the tool) and either
     subdirectories or links to other components (eg BOINC utilities).
     Future segregation into presentation code and supporting code
     might be useful.

   * Cross site authentication is not so strict that it fails when
     parsing the token when it's a non-critical part.   This makes
     authentication less likely to cause problems.

   * If the analysis runs with no error but no image file is found
     then we might just be early and it's not converted or returned
     yet.  Try again (5 times) before we give up.

   * If the user tried to visit Plot Graph tab but they have not yet
     finished at the Control Panel (and pressed GO) then they are
     brought back to Control Panel with an error message.
     (Now we need to make it so that they can go back and forth
     between tabs at will after a plot has been created, to create the 
     next analysis.)


=== 0.35 ===
('testing' on 19 June 2007, production on 2 August 2007)

   * Added an attempt at some interpretation of return codes from
     running the ROOT script or supporting scripts.   This is better
     than just getting an error code number.   Some relabling and
     grouping of error codes to make tracking the source easier.
    
   * Macros loaded from DMT_ROOT_MACROS, dynamic libraries loaded
     from DMT_ROOT_LIBS.  Still the same places, but these can now
     be changed as needed.

   * Scripts update-rds.php and copy-rds.php moved to bin directory.
     They are smarter about finding where the data lives and setting
     paramters based on trend type.


=== 0.34=== 
('testing' on 15 May 2007)

   * Beginner and intermediate channel selector now has links to glossary

   * Change "device" to "source" internally.   Beginners get "site" but 
       this should really by "source" for more advanced users.   

   * PEM seismic channels available for beginners.

   * Added second-trend channels (raw channels don't quite work yet,
    but we are close).

   * Handle BLRM with hyphen separated frequency range, so that new
    sub-microseism 0.01-0.3Hz channels can be used (level 3).

   * Fixed problem entering times as GPS times.

   * Fixed problem with scale change after plot has been revised a
    couple of times.

   * Frames on the fly: When you are going to run an analysis using
    second trends, when you go from data selection to the control
    panel is launches a task in the background to run `update-rds.php -x` 
    on tekoa (either locally or via ssh if it's remote) and then
    copy-rds.php if not on tekoa.  The control panel monitors the task
    and only presents the "GO" button when the task is done.

    I don't necessarily like this - I think one could also just run a
    specific transformation to do this - but it works and is something
    to try for now.

   * Ticket sent to remote server now includes name of the server we
    are jumping from.  Can be used later to check against referer, and/or
    to access user database on one of several possible feeder sites.
  
   * Known problem: if your session gets stale the automatic
    authentication handoff from spy-hill to tekoa may fail, and you'll
    be asked to log-in again, even though you were logged in.


=== 0.33=== 
('testing' on 26 Mar 2007, 'production' 17 April 2007)

   * Cross-server authentication works.  

   * Add sub-microseism 0.01-0.3Hz BLRM channels to the list (they are
    not yet usable)

   * Add working GPS clock for advanced users, implemented in JavaScript.

   * Head-shot images on auth_required.php make it easier to choose
    between user login and guest login.

   * Organize each display page to handle inputs in proper order.
    Debug level is adjusted first, reset is tested last, as it will
    clear anything before it, as it should.  Then show "general"
    variables, then variables specific to the page.

   * Auto_apply now works in all cases

   * Split require_authentication() to a separate piece 
    check_authentication() just to check for authentication.

   * Split handle_reset() into a part to check and a part to do it.

   * If /tmp/debug exists and we can open a file there for writing then
    all debug messages are copied there. 
  
   * Added "units" to the channel Object, and set it for BLRMS and PEM
    channels.


=== 0.32=== 
('testing' on 20 Feb 2007, never released for 'production')

   * Fixed problem where y-axis lable gets moved to left edge of pad
    whenever a plot is modified. 

   * For the lower user levels the input selection box is a vertical list of
    items, not one horizontal bar.  A "sampling" item has been added,
    though it is fixed on "minute trend, mean" for now.

   * user_level 2 (beginner) is not allowed to run an analysis over
    300 sec (5min).  A warning is shown if over 60 sec (1min). 

   * User's session is automatically reset if it's over an hour old.

   * user_level 5 (Super-Expert) shows up for 7 seconds but then 
    reverts to "Advanced" - just to show off that higher levels are 
    possible

   * Authentication can either be based on a user's personal account
    on the discussion site (using BOINC's auth system) or using a
    'guest' account (using HTTP Basic auth via web browser).
    Fixed "forgotten password" link, and fixed logout.   If you are
    logged in via a 'guest' account you are told you must close your
    browser to really be logged out.

    Cross-site authentication is still not available.  This is just
    for authentication by one of two methods on the same server.

   * GDS monitor names show up in plot title (now just "EARTHQUAKE")
    (but it's not yet updating in real time in the channel selector)

   * macros.php looks for $tla_src_path and includes all file with
    that prefix.  This will makes things a bit more portable.


=== 0.31=== 
('testing' on 12 December 2006, 'production' on 18 January 2007)

   * Each session runs the analysis in it's own working directory,
    called a 'slot'.   

   * Thus the session_id is still in the URL, but now as a directory, 
    so it is not a part of the name of the file.  This means saving
    the image or log file with "Save As..." is much simpler.

   * Locate the top level data directory using environmental variable
     DATA_DIR.  This means we can find data on spy-hill and tekoa
     without having to edit source files.


=== 0.29=== 
('production' on 1 December 2006)

   * no notes on what was added when before this, but you could
     probably check the CVS checkin notes if it really matters.
