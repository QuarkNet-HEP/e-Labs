			The LIGO Analsis Tool

The code here is for a web-based interactive Analysis Tool, designed
originally for LIGO PEM and DMT/PEM data for the I2U2 project.

See the file DESIGN_NOTES for the details of how it works or why it
  works a particular way.

See the file RELEASE_NOTES to see what is new or what's been changed.

See http://i2u2.spy-hill.net for the logbook/discussion site and links
to a working version of the tool (and possibly test and development
versions as well).

Feel free to send me any questions, comments, or suggestions.
