<strong>Data Monitoring Tool</strong>
<p>
The Data Monitoring Tool (DMT) is a LIGO <a href="javascript:glossary('data channel subsystem',100)">subsystem</a> built from software. The DMT takes raw data from instruments such as 
<a href="javascript:glossary('seismometer',100)">seismometers</a> and runs the data through various types of mathematical processes. A set of DMT channels take data from LIGO's 
seismometers and splits the data into various frequency bands. You'll see these frequency bands in the labels on the sensor 
list when the subsystem is set to DMT.
