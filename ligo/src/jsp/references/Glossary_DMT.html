<strong>DMT</strong>
<p>
The Data Monitoring Tool (DMT) is a LIGO software subsystem that performs various tasks on raw data that LIGO collects.  These tasks might include the filtering of data or the application of calibrations to the data to associate it with relevant units of measurement.   In the LIGO e-Lab, the frequency-filtered channels of seismometer data belong to the DMT subsystem because these channels have been processed from the raw data which comes from the PEM subsystem.
