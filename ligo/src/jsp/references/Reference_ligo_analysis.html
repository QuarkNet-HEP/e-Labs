<B>Milestone: Analyze data to answer your research question</b>
<p> 
<I>
To meet this milestone, you must develop an answer (a hypothesis) for your
research question.  You've identified a seismic event, trend or pattern on
one or more plots that you have made.  Now you are saying "I think that
this event, trend or pattern is caused by ______ ."  Is your idea a good
one?  You'll find out as you tackle the next
milestone!
