<B>Milestone: Gather data to answer your research question.</b><p> <I>Sometimes, features in new data are puzzling, and scientists consider many possible explanations for those features. Which explanations are more reasonable or more likely? Which explanations seem less likely or more far-fetched? There is no substitute for careful, reasoned thinking in scientific research.</i><p>To pursue your research, you must find relevant data that "fits" your question. Once you have an idea about the cause of a seismic event or feature in the LIGO seismic data, look for evidence of this event or feature in further plots. Is your idea a good one; is it supported by other data?  </p><p>Scientific research is <b>iterative</b>. As you "figure it out," you will circle around the loop more than once to refine your analyses.</p><P STYLE="margin-left: 	  10px"><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('/ligo/tla/',800,600)">Bluestone</a><br>  <A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('/ligo/tla/tutorial.php',800,600)">Bluestone Tutorial</a><br> </p><p>Keep track of interesting results in your logbook.</p> <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../jsp/logEntry.jsp?keyword=ligo_analysis',700,600)"><b>Log it!</b><IMG SRC="../graphics/logbook_pencil.gif" border="0"	  align="middle"></A>
