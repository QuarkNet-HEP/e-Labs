<B>Milestone: Gather data to diagnose noise.</b>
<p> 
<I>Sometimes, features in new data are puzzling, and scientists consider many possible explanations for those features. Which explanations are more reasonable or more likely? Which explanations seem less likely or more far-fetched? There is no substitute for careful, reasoned thinking in scientific research.</i>
<p>
You must find relevant data. Once you have an idea about the cause of a seismic event or feature in the LIGO seismic data, look for evidence of this event or feature in other plots. Is your idea a good one; is it supported by other data?
