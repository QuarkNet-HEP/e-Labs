<B>Milestone: Ask other questions.</b>
<p>
<i>Scientists love mysteries. They know that one research question leads to others.</i></p>

<p>What was the result when you tested your idea about seismic data? Did your idea hold up? Whether the data supported your idea or not, the results of your research should lead you to ask additional questions.</p>

<p>Write new research questions that come from your original research in your logbook.</p>
