<strong>Milestone: Examine and become familiar with LIGO seismic data.</strong>

<p><em>Research proposals center on a single, well-designed research question that can be answered by collecting and analyzing data.</em></p>

<p>The LIGO observatories each run six seismometers in different locations along the beam tubes. You need to know these locations and how they are labeled to analyze the data.</p>

<p>Bluestone is our LIGO analysis tool. Take some time to practice making plots with Bluestone.<p>

<p>Use the navigation bar to go to Bluestone.  Click on <b>Practice Plots</b> on the right.</p>

<p>As you make more plots, look for interesting features of the data.  You can save plots in your logbook. Eventually you'll need to pick a feature as the focus of your research.</p>


<p>In your logbook insert  the two most interesting plots that you saved. Add some comments about what you find interesting in your plots and what might be a research question you could investigate.</p>
