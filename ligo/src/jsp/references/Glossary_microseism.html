<b>Microseism</b>
<p>
<strong>Microseism</strong> literally means "small earthquake". Microseisms are continuous low-frequency seismic tremors that are caused by ocean waves. 
You can watch the microseismic signal change at LIGO by plotting the 0.1 - 0.3 Hz seismic channels in the DMT subsystem: SEIS(X,Y,Z)_0.1_0.3Hz.
