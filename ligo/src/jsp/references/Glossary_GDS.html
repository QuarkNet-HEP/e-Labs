<strong>Global Diagnostic System</strong>
<p>
The Global Diagnostic System (GDS), like the <a href="Glossary_DMT.html">DMT</a>, is a software <a href="Glossary_data_channel_subsystem.html">subsystem</a> that 
takes raw data from sensors such as <a href="Glossary_seismometer.html">seismometers</a> and performs processes on the data to help answer certain questions. 
Only one GDS sensor (channel) is available in I2U2. This is an earthquake monitor. 
If operating correctly, this GDS channel gives plots that show when earthquake waves pass by LIGO.
