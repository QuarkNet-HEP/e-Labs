<strong>Global Diagnostic System</strong>
<p>
The Global Diagnostic System (GDS), like the <a href="javascript:glossary('DMT',100)">DMT</a>, is a software <a href="javascript:glossary('data channel subsystem',100)">subsystem</a> that 
takes raw data from sensors such as <a href="javascript:glossary('seismometer',100)">seismometers</a> and performs processes on the data to help answer certain questions. 
Only one GDS sensor (channel) is available in the e-Lab. This is an earthquake monitor. 
If operating correctly, this GDS channel gives plots that show when earthquake waves pass by LIGO.
