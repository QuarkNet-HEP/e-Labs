<strong>Global Diagnostic System</strong>
<p>
The Global Diagnostic System (GDS), like the DMT, is a software subsystem that takes raw data from sensors such as 
seismometers and performs processes on the data to help answer certain questions. 
Only one GDS sensor (channel) is available in the LIGO e-Lab, and only in the first LIGO data archive. 
This is an earthquake monitor. If operating correctly, this GDS channel gives plots that show when earthquake waves pass by LIGO.
