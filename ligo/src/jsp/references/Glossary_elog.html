<b>Elog</b>
<p>
The LIGO E-Log is an electronic logbook which LIGO uses as the master record of detector operations. 
LIGO personnel are required to make E-Log entries for all circumstances related to the operation of the detectors and any changes that are made to the detectors. 
"If it's not in the E-Log, it didn't happen." The E-Logs are viewable on the Web using the links below and the access words "reader" and "readonly" (no quotes). 
I2U2 users might find LIGO's E-Logs helpful because the E-Logs often mention seismic disturbances that affect the detectors.
