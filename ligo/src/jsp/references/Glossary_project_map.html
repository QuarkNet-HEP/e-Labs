The Project Map is a graphical interface that guides you through the e-Lab. It is accessible from the main navigation bar. 
To navigate the LIGO e-Lab, follow the arrows and complete the milestones. The small colored circles are milestones 
Those with double circles are Milestone Seminars, opportunities to discuss your progress with your teacher. Hover over each circle to preview, 
then click to open the milestone. Follow the instructions to complete the milestone. 
Project milestones are on the four branch lines Ð The Basics, Get Started, Figure it Out and Tell Others.
