<B>Milestone: Learn how to read and estimate wave frequencies.</b>
<p> 
<I>LIGO scientists study plots of the physics data looking for the gravitational waves that no one has ever seen.</I> 

<p>You will be studying a particular feature in the LIGO seismic data to determine the source. Was it caused by an earthquake, traffic driving by or maybe a rabbit hopping?</p>

<p>Develop your skills! LIGO separates seismic data into frequency bands. You will need to be able to read frequencies on the plots. Study an example and then practice estimating the frequencies on new plots.</p>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 10px"><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../library/ref-frequencies.jsp',600,600)">Sample Plots</a></p>

<p>
Record your frequency estimates from the sample plots in your logbook. Explain why LIGO separates seismic data into frequency bands.</p>
