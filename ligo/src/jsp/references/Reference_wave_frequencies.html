<strong>Milestone: Learn how to estimate wave frequencies.</strong>

<p><em>LIGO scientists study plots of interferometer data to look for wave signals.</em></p> 

<p>You will make and stuy plots of LIGO seismometer data to look for interesting seismic signals. You might choose to study a particular event or feature in the LIGO seismic data to determine the source. Was it caused by an earthquake, traffic driving by or maybe a rabbit hopping?</p>

<p>LIGO separates seismic data into frequency bands. You will need to be able to interpret the frequency labels on the plots. For example, you might see the label <u>Seismic x, Bandwidth filtered, 1 - 3 Hz</u> where 1-3 Hz is the frequency band for the plot. (Herz, Hz, is the number of cycles per second.)</p>

<p>Study the examples and practice estimating the frequencies on new plots. </p>

<p>Record your frequency estimates from the sample plots in your logbook. Explain why LIGO separates seismic data into frequency bands.</p>
