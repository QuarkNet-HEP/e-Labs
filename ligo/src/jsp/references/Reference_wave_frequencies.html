<B>Milestone: Learn how to estimate wave frequencies.</b>
<p> 
<I>LIGO scientists study plots of the physics data looking for the gravitational waves that no one has ever seen.</I> 

<p>You will be studying a particular feature in the LIGO seismic data to determine the source. Was it caused by an earthquake, traffic driving by or maybe a rabbit hopping?</p>

<p>LIGO separates seismic data into frequency bands. You will need to be able to interpret the frequency labels on the plots. For example, you might see the label <u>Seismic x, Bandwidth filtered, 0.1 - 0.3 Hz</u> where 0.1-0.3 Hz is the frequency band for the plot.</p><p> Get a better sense of different frequencies. Study the examples and then practice estimating the frequencies on new plots.</p>

<p>
Record your frequency estimates from the sample plots in your logbook. Explain why LIGO separates seismic data into frequency bands.</p>
