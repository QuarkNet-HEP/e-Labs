<strong>Milestone: Describe basic wave properties.</strong>

<p><em>Background information is part of any research proposal. Scientists create new knowledge by building on basic science principles.</em></p> 

<p>To use LIGO's seismic data, you need to understand wave properties. What interesting wave measurements can you make? You may already know about familiar waves&#8212;water waves, light waves or sound waves. What about seismic waves, those that result from the ground shaking?</p>

<p>Briefly describe these properties of seismic waves in your logbook: speed, wavelength, frequency, amplitude and arrival time.</p>
