<B>Milestone: Describe basic wave properties.</b><p> 

<I>Research proposals center on a single, well-designed research question that can be answered by collecting and analyzing data.</I> 

<p>To use LIGO's seismic data, you need to understand wave properties. What interesting measurements can we make? You may already know about familiar waves&#8212water waves, light waves or sound waves. What about seismic waves, those that result from the ground shaking?</p>

<p>Briefly describe these properties of seismic waves in your logbook: speed, wavelength, frequency, amplitude and arrival time.</p>
