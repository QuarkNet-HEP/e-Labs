<b>GPS Time</b>
<p>
GPS time is the time that is measured on atomic clocks on GPS satellites. 
Time zero in the GPS system was 00:00:00 (midnight) on 6 January 1980 UTC. 
GPS time does not account for the lengthening of days because of the slowing rotation of the Earth, so, unlike UTC, GPS time does not use leap seconds. 
Otherwise it progresses at the same rate as UTC and TAI.
