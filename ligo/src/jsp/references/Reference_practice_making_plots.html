<B>Milestone: Practice making plots of LIGO data</b>
<p> 
<I>
You can use LIGO's Bluestone software to plot LIGO seismic data.  Before
you establish a research question and research plan, practice by making a
number of different seismic plots.  These will help you get a feel for the
appearance of the data.  You will also learn how to choose a seismometer
and a data channel.  As you make more plots, you'll start to recognize
interesting features of the data.  Eventually you'll need to pick a feature
and make it the focus of your research question and research plan.  Use the
Bluestone tutorial to help you learn how to plot
data.
