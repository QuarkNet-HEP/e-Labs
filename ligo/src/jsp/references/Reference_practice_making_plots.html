<B>Milestone: Learn how to read seismic data.</b>
<p> 
<I>Research proposals center on a single, well-designed research question that can be answered by collecting and analyzing data.</I></p>

<p>Develop your skills! You must look for patterns that tell you aboaut the source and of a seismic data plots. Was it an earthquake, a truck driving by or maybe a rabbit hopping?</p>

<p>Study four sample plots. Find key features that distinguish one from another. LINK</p> 

<p>Now, use the key features you identified to sort these plots into four categories, one for each source. LINK</p>

<P>Record your results in your logbook.</p>
