<B>Milestone: Learn how to read LIGO seismic data.</b>
<p> 
<I>Research proposals center on a single, well-designed research question that can be answered by collecting and analyzing data.</I></p>

<p> 
Get to know the seismic data by making a number of different practice plots.</p>  
<P STYLE="margin-left: 10px">How did the ground shake at LIGO on your birthday?<br>
What does the data look like for a whole week?<br>
What does the data look like on the same day for several years?

<p>
As you make more plots, you'll start to recognize interesting features of the data.  Eventually you'll need to pick a feature as the focus of your research.</p>

<p>The <A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../data/tutorial.jsp',800,600)">tutorial</a> will show you how to use <A HREF="/ligo/tla/" target="_blank">Bluestone</a> to create a plot.</p>

<P>Keep track of the interesting plots you make in your logbook.</p>
