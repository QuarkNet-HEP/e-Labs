<strong>Milestone: Explain why LIGO monitors the seismic environments at the observatories.</strong>

<p><em>Scientists gather data to answer research questions. The data comes with Scientists must separate the "signal" from the "noise" in their data. Noise is like static in a radio. </em></p>

<p>LIGO scientists want to detect gravitational waves, ripples of space, that reach Earth as tiny waves.</p> 

<p>However, seismic waves generated by earthquakes, hurricanes, air conditioners and many other sources  can shake the LIGO interferometer mirrors. This lowers the sensitivity of the detectors to gravitational waves.</p>

<p>LIGO scientists continually record data from seismometers to better understand the relationship between ground vibrations and the performance of the detectors.</p>
