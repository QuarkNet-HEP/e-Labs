<B>Milestone: Explain why LIGO monitors the environment at the observatories.</b>

<p><i>Scientists trying to measure a certain signal must minimize the effects of other signals in the data called "noise." Scientists must separate the signal of interest from background noise. </i></p>

<p>LIGO scientists want to detect gravitational waves, energeic ripples of space, that reach Earth as tiny waves.</p> 

<P>However, seismic waves generated by earthquakes, hurricanes, ocean waves, falling trees, vehicles, footsteps and many other sources  can shake the LIGO interferometer mirrors. This lowers the sensitivity of the detectors to gravitational waves.</p>

<p>LIGO scientists continually record data from seismometers to better understand the relationship between ground vibrations and the performance of the detectors.</p>

<p>Brainstorm possible sources of this noise in your logbook.</p>
<p>Find out where the LIGO seismometers that record this noise are located. You can attach a map in your e-Logbook.
