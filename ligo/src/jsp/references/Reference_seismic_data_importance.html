<B>Milestone: Explain why LIGO monitors the environment at the observatories.</b>

<p><i>Scientists gather data to answer research questions. The data comes with "noise" like static in a radio. Scientists have to separate the data from the noise. </i></p>

<p>LIGO scientists want to detect gravitational waves, energeic ripples of space, that reach Earth as tiny waves.</p> 

<P>However, seismic waves generated by earthquakes, hurricanes, air conditioners and many other sources  can shake the LIGO interferometer mirrors. This lowers the sensitivity of the detectors to gravitational waves.</p>

<p>LIGO scientists continually record data from seismometers to better understand the relationship between ground vibrations and the performance of the detectors.</p>
