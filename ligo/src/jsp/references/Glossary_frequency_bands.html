<strong>Frequency Bands</strong>
<p>
The term “band” refers to a range of frequencies.  For instance the phrase “audio band” refers to the range of frequencies that humans can hear, 
roughly 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 KHz).  LIGO separates its raw seismometer data into six different frequency bands.  
Each band tells LIGO scientists something different about the way that the ground shakes at LIGO’s Observatory sites.
