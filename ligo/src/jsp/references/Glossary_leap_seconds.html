<strong>Leap Seconds</strong>
<p>
Solar time is a timekeeping system that's based on the Sun's position in the sky. 
UTC is a timekeeping system that’s based on seconds that tick by on highly precise atomic clocks. 
The Earth's rotation isn't highly regular.  Eventually these irregularities would cause solar time and UTC to grow apart from each other, 
a circumstance that would cause disruptions in a number of areas of human activity. The keep UTC aligned with solar time, 
leap seconds occasionally are added to or subtracted from UTC time. 
Usually leap seconds are added because tidal forces tend to lengthen the Earth's period of revolution.
