<strong>Milestone: Learn how to read seismic data.</strong>

<p><em>Research proposals center on a single, well-designed research question that can be answered by collecting and analyzing data.</em></p>

<p>Develop your skills! You will be looking for a particular pattern that indicates the source of a seismic wave. Was it an earthquake, a truck driving by or maybe a rabbit hopping?</p>

<p>Study examples of seismic wave plots from four sources to find key features that distinguish one plot from another. <!-- LINK --></p> 

<p>Now, use the key features you identified to sort these plots according to source. <!-- LINK --></p>

<p>Record your results in your logbook.</p>
