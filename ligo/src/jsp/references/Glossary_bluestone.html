<strong>Bluestone</strong>
<p>
<strong>Bluestone</strong> is the analysis tool for the <a href="">LIGO e-Lab</a>. It provides a web-based interface which lets you select which LIGO 
data you will process and which transformations you will apply to the data. The interface is similar to that of analysis tools used by LIGO scientists in the 
LIGO control rooms, such as <a href="javascript:glossary('DMT',100)">DMT</a>, <a href="javascript:glossary('DTT',100)">DTT</a>, 
and <a href="">DataViewer.</a>
<br /><br />
Bluestone, has a <strong>user level</strong>, which allows you to control the complexity of the interface. If you are a beginner, you can select the 
Beginner level and get step-by-step instructions on how to perform an analysis. Then you can move to the Intermediate level, which gives you more control 
options and less verbose assistance. At the Advanced level you have a wider range of options, and the controls are very close to what is used in the LIGO control rooms.
