<strong>Milestone: Plan a data analysis investigation.</strong>

<p><em>The research question organizes all aspects of the project. A clear research question determines how scientists  do their research and what resources they will need. Data analysis is an important part of scientific inquiry.</em></p>


<p> There are two very important items that you need to create:

<p style="margin-left: 10px">1. What is your research question? What do you want to ask about LIGO seismic data that will focuse your investigation?</p></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px">2. What is your plan for doing the investigation? Be specific! What plots will you need to make with Bluestone? Is there outside information that you'll need, such as data on the U.S. Geological Survey website?</p>

<p>Your research question and research plan may change as you work on your investigation.</p>

<p> Here are <a href=>studies</a> you can do with LIGO seismic data.</p> 

<p>To get ideas for your research question, you can look at the posters to see what other students have done.</p>




<p>Write your research questions and research plan in your logbook. </p>
