<B>Milestone: Make a research question and plan.</b>

<p><I>Knowing the research question organizes all aspects of the project. It determines the model used to predict results. It helps determine the plan to marshal resources&#8212time and money and equipment and manpower.</I></p>

<p> What have you seen in the research that you have done so far that makes you wonder about ground vibrations and seismic waves?  How can you use additional plots to help you learn more?  </p> 

<p>Remember, a good research question <b>must</b> allow you to pursue the answer through additional research.</p>  <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../library/ref-plan.jsp',600,600)">Plan Outline</A> - Elements that can be included in a research plan<br> <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../library/ref-question.jsp')">How to begin</A> - Develop a research question<br>  

<p>Write your question and plan in your logbook. (You may want to make additional plots and/or look at additional seismic information.) </p>
