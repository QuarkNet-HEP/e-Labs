<B>Milestone: Make a research question and plan.</b>

<p><I>The research question organizes all aspects of the project. A clear research question determines how scientists  do their research and what resources they will need.</I></p>

<p> What interesting events or features have you seen in the LIGO data that you have studied so far? Think of the processes that might have caused the event or feature. But think carefully! You may be able to rule out a number of explanations that don't match the nature of the event.</p>
<p> What questions do you have about ground vibrations and seismic waves?  What will you need to look for in  additional plots to answer your research question?  </p> 

<p>Remember, a good research question <b>must</b> allow you to pursue the answer through additional research.</p>  <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../library/ref-plan.jsp',600,600)">Plan Outline</A> - Elements that can be included in a research plan<br> <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../library/ref-question.jsp')">How to begin</A> - Develop a research question.<br>  

<p>Write your question and plan in your logbook. (You may want to make additional plots and/or look at additional seismic information.) </p>
