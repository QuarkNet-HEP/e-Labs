<B>Milestone: Make a research question and a research plan</b><p> <I>Ask a question about seismic data and develop a plan to answer your question by making additional plots and/or by looking at additional seismic information.  What have you seen in the research that you have done so far that makes you wonder about ground vibrations adn seismic waves?  HOw can you use additional plots to help you learn more?  Describe your questions and your plan.</I></p> <p>Remember -- a good research question <u>must</u> allow you to pursue the answer through additional research.</p>  <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../library/ref-plan.jsp',600,600)">Plan Outline</A> - Elements that can be included in a research plan<br> <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../library/ref-question.jsp')">How to begin</A> - Develop a research question<br>  <P><HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../jsp/logEntry.jsp?keyword=ligo_research_question',700,600)"><b>Log it!</b><IMG SRC="../graphics/logbook_pencil.gif" border="0"  align="middle"></A> <P> <B>References</B></p>
