<strong>Milestone: Plan a data analysis investigation.</strong>

<p><em>The research question organizes all aspects of the project. A clear research question determines how scientists  do their research and what resources they will need. Data analysis is an important part of scientific inquiry.</em></p>

<p> What interesting events or features have you seen in the LIGO data that you have studied so far? Think of the processes that might have caused the event or feature. But think carefully! You may be able to rule out a number of explanations that don't match the nature of the event.</p>

<p> There are two very important items that you need to create:

<p style="margin-left: 10px">1. What is your research question? What do you want to ask about LIGO seismic data that will focuse your investigation?</p></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px">2. What is your plan for doing the investigation? Be specific! What plots will you need to make with Bluestone? Is there outside information that you'll need, such as data on the U.S. Geological Survey website?</p>
<p>Your research question and research plan may change as you work on your investigation.</p>


<p>Write your research questions and research plan in your logbook. </p>
