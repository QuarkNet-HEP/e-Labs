<strong>Milestone: Plan a data analysis investigation.</strong>

<p><em>The research question organizes all aspects of the project. A clear research question determines how scientists  do their research and what resources they will need. Data analysis is an important part of scientific inquiry.</em></p>

<p> What interesting events or features have you seen in the LIGO data that you have studied so far? Think of the processes that might have caused the event or feature. But think carefully! You may be able to rule out a number of explanations that don't match the nature of the event.</p>

<p> What researchable questions do you have about ground vibrations and seismic waves?  What will you need to look for in  additional plots to answer your question?</p>  

<p>Write your question and plan in your logbook.</p>
