<strong>Laser and Vacuum Equipment Area (LVEA)</strong>
<p>
The <strong>Laser and Vacuum Equipment Area</strong> (LVEA) is the area where the beam tubes meet in a LIGO detector. LIGO's interferometers have an "L" shape. 
The LVEA is the interior of the building at the vertex of the L. The LVEA is a laser safety area that requires special precautions and clean room clothing for entry. 
There is a seismometer in each LIGO LVEA that is part of the I2U2 data network.
