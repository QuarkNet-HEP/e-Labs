<B>Milestone: Test your answer.</b><p> <I>You've seen something interesting in your data, you've asked a question about it, and you've come up with an answer for your question.  Now for one of the trickiest parts of the scientific method -- you need to find out if your answer is strong or if it needs to be revised. How do you do this?  Think carefully!  Make a prediction about what a new plot whould look like if your hypothesis is correct, then make the new plot to check your prediction.  Or you may wish to look at other seismic data, from places like USGS or IRIS.  The LIGO Hanford E-Log may also be useful.   </I> <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../jsp/logEntry.jsp?keyword=ligo_test_answer',700,600)"><b>Log it!</b><IMG SRC="../graphics/logbook_pencil.gif" border="0"  align="middle"></A> <P><B>References</B>
