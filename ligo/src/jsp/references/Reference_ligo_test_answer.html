<strong>Milestone: Test your answer.</strong>

<p><em>Scientists run many analyses to gain confidence that their data makes the strongest case to support their ideas.</em></p>

<p>You've seen something interesting in the data.</p>

<p>Now for one of the trickiest parts of scientific research&#8212;measuring your confidence that the data support your answer. How many plots do you think are necessary to be confident in your answer? </p>

<p>Think carefully! You may want to make more plots to see if your answer is correct.  You may need to look at other seismic data from places like USGS or IRIS.  The LIGO Hanford e-Log may also be useful.</p>

<p>Keep repeating the cycle of analyze-test until you can produce clear and convincing evidence.  You might go through the cycle once or many times.  Your goal is to create the strongest possible explanation of the event, trend or pattern in your data.</p>
