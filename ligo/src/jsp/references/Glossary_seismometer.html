<strong>Seismometer</strong>
<p>
A <strong>seismometer</strong> is a device for measuring the motion of the earth. Seismometers can be used to detect earthquakes, 
but they may also be used to detect other kinds of ground motion.
<br />
<strong>How they work</strong><br />
A magnetic test mass is suspended between two wire coils. As seismic waves pass through the seismometer, 
the coils move, but the test mass remains at rest because of its inertia. The movement of the coils relative to the magnetic mass induces 
an electric current that can be detected and plotted on a graphical interface.<br />
