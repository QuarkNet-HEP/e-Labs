<b>Sampling</b>
<p>
For DMT channels, you will see <strong>rms</strong> as the only option in this field. For PEM channels you will see <strong>rms</strong> and <strong>mean</strong>. 
rms stands for "Root Mean Square" and is calculated by squaring each individual value in the data set, 
summing all the squared values, dividing the sum by the number of values and taking the square root. <br />
Beware of choosing <strong>mean</strong> when looking at PEM channels. The mean sometimes will cause the (+) and (-) swings in the 
seismometer signals to cancel out, leading the investigator to conclude that the seismic signal was smaller than was actually the case.
