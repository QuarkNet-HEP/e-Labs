<b>Data Channel Station</b>
<p>
<strong>Station</strong> refers to the LIGO building in which a particular seismometer is located. 
LIGO Livingston has four stations, the <a href="Glossary_LVEA.html">LVEA</a>
(also called the corner station), the End X station (EX), the End Y station (EY) and a Vault. 
LIGO Hanford has the same four stations plus two more*, the Mid X station (MX) and the Mid Y station (MY).
<br />
The "Vault" stations are concrete vaults in the ground outside of LIGO's buildings. 
The Vault seismometers are placed in these enclosures. The LVEA, Mid and End station seismometers are placed 
on the concrete floors of LIGO's buildings.
<br />
Use the <strong>LIGO Maps</strong> link on the Resources list (Library menu) in the e-Lab to find a LIGO site diagram 
that shows the locations of the stations.
<br />
LIGO Hanford operates two gravitational wave interferometers (H1 and H2) and LIGO Livingston operates one (L1). 
Before Advanced LIGO, one of Hanford's detectors (H2) was 2 kilometers on a side. The Mid Station buildings at LIGO Hanford 
housed the end mirrors for this 2-km detector. Advanced LIGO will result in the conversion of H2 to a four-kilometer detector, the same length as H1 and L1.
The Mid Station buildings will remain, as will the MX and MY seismometers inside them.
