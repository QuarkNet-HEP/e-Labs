<B>Milestone: Look for patterns in LIGO seismic data.</b>
<p> 
<I>Research proposals center on a single, well-designed research question that can be answered by collecting and analyzing data.</I></p>

<p>Make a number of practice plots with <A HREF="/ligo/tla/" target="_blank">Bluestone</a>. </p>  
<P STYLE="margin-left: 10px">How did the ground shake at LIGO on your birthday?<br>
What does the data look like for a whole week?<br>
What does the data look like on the same day for several years?</p>

<p>(The <A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../data/tutorial.jsp',800,600)">tutorial</a> will show you how to create a plot.)</p>

<p>
As you make more plots, look for interesting features of the data.  You can save plots in your logbook. Eventually you'll need to pick a feature as the focus of your research.</p>


<p>The LIGO Hanford Observatory runs six seismometers in different locations
along the beam tubes.  You need to know these locations and how
they are labeled to analyze the data.</p>

<p>Attach one of your Bluestone practice plots to the logbook and comment on the interesting things in this plot.</p>
