<strong>Bandwidth-filtered</strong>
<p>
This phrase refers to the process of splitting LIGOÕs raw seismometer data into frequency bands.  
Data from a particular frequency band is called Òbandwidth filtered.Ó  Computers are programmed to apply mathematical filters to the raw data. 
The nature of the filter will determine the width of the frequency and that it creates.
