<b>Data Channel Sensor</b>
<p>
Each <a href="Glossary_seismometer.html">seismometer</a> at LIGO contains three individual sensors labeled x, y and z. The x and y sensors measure horizontal vibrations in perpendicular directions, 
in the directions of the x and y arms of the interferometer. The z sensor measures vertical vibrations. 
In the <a href="Glossary_DMT.html">DMT</a> subsystem, data from each of these sensors on each seismometer is filtered into five different frequency bands. 
That's why you see so many entries on the sensor list in the DMT subsystem.
<br />
There are six seismometers at the LIGO Hanford site and four at LIGO Livingston, one in each station plus the vault. 
Each seismometer has three sensors, and, in the DMT subsystem, the signal from each sensor is filtered into five different bandwidth-filtered channels. 
So it is important to distinguish between a "channel" of data and the "sensor" that it came from -- they are different things.
