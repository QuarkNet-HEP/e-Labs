<strong>Physics Environment Monitoring</strong>
<p>
The LIGO <strong>Physics Environment Monitoring</strong> (PEM) system draws in about 100 channels of data from seismometers, tiltmeters, magnetometers, 
electrical-line monitoring equipment, weather stations, radio-frequency monitors and a cosmic-ray-shower detector. PEM data are used to learn how the interferometers 
are affected by changes in the physical environment, and to check whether environmental parameters were "nominal" when candidate gravitational-wave events were recorded.
