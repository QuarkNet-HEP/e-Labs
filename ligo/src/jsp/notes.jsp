<B>A Beginning Look at Sensor Data</B><BR>
Students should make a set of initial plots to get familiar with the appearance of sensor data.  LIGO's environmental sensors are probed several times per second and teh data is averaged into trends of minutes or hours.  When plotted, these data show a noisy baseline.  Students who are unfamiliar with these types of plots will need to learn to distinguish between noise and signals of interest, and this task makes an interesting study.  If you think that you've identified an interesting feature in the data, how can you verify that its not an excursion of the typical noise that appears on that sensor channel?

<B>Earthquake searches</B><BR>
Earthquake studies allow students to move their emerging data-recognition skills into the realm of isolated seismic events.  Many interesting questions related to earthquake behavior can quickly arise from a consideration of LIGO's seismic data.  The most basic question -- is it an earthquake or some other type of disturbance? -- gives students an opportunity to compare LIGO's data to seismic networks that are available on the Web.
