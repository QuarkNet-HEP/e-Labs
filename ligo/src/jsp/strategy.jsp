<P>

 e-Labs are independent student investigations. Teachers need to manage the execution of e-Labs in a way that grants students a reasonable level of independence while maintaining a reasonable level of order. Some items for teacher consideration:

<P><ul>
<li>Are there enough computers available for students to work individually at workstations? If not, will you have the students work together, perhaps in pairs, or will you pursue another strategy such as having some students work on e-Labs while others undertake a different activity?
<li>What short-term checks of student progress can you develop that will hold students accountable for their use of time?
<li>How much course time can you devote to e-Labs? Will this be continuous time or will e-Labs be interspersed with other couresework?
<li>How can you tie e-Labs into a science course so that the e-Labs naturally support your larger course objectives? </ul>
