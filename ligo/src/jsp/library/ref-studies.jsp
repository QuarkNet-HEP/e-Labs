Think of the processes that might have caused the event or feature. But think carefully! You may be able to rule out a number of explanations that don't match the nature of the event.</p><p style="margin-left: 10px"><b>Earthquake Studies</b> - LIGO's seismometer data supports many research questions related to earthquakes. Look for earthquakes in the data in LIGO's low-frequency seismic channels, 0.03 to 0.1 Hz and 0.1 Hz to 0.3 Hz.</p><p><p style="margin-left: 10px"><b>Environment Correlation Studies</b> - Can you see relationships between seismic activity at LIGO and other environmental influences such as rainfall, wind patterns or temperature changes?</p><p><p style="margin-left: 10px"><b>Human Activity Studies</b> - Can you see relationships between seismic activity at LIGO and human activities such as traffic patterns?</p><p><p style="margin-left: 10px"><b>Microseism Studies</b> - Ocean waves produce seismic signals in the 0.1 - 0.3 Hz band of frequencies. Can you see relationships between ground vibrations at LIGO and wind and wave activity on the oceans?</p></div>		<hr>		<p><a href="javascript:window.close();"><font size="-1">Close Window</A></p>		</div>	</body></html>
