Use the following checklist.</P><ul><li> Make a plot of 2009 seismic data using H0, DMT,  EY - SEISZ_1_3Hz, and rms as your Data Selection values.<li> Click the <b>Y-Axis Log Scale</b> checkbox.<li> Click <b>Add Data Row</b>.  Use the same Data Selection values for the second row but change station EY to station LVEA (see the LIGO Hanford site map to view the locations of the seismometer stations).<li> Zoom in on this plot so that you are looking at a single week of data from both channels.<li> Now change the Sensor for each plot to SEISZ_0.1_0.3 Hz. Save your plot. </ul><p>Now you will want to start moving towards a research question for your investigation.  Feel free to continue exploring on your own by making more plots!  If you need some guidance, use the next checklist.</P><UL><li>Make and save a plot of May 2008.  Plot these four sensors (frequency bands) for Site H0:  SEISZ_0.03_0.1Hz, SEISZ_0.1_0.3Hz, SEISZ_1_3Hz and SEISZ_3_10Hz.  Save your plots so that you can compare them to each other.<li>What are some questions that come to mind when you compare these plots to each other?<li>Make and save a single plot of October 28, 2009.  Use the SEISZ_1_3Hz sensors for H0 and L0.<li>What are some questions that come to mind as you look at this plot?</li><ul></div>		<hr>		<p><a href="javascript:window.close();"><font size="-1">Close Window</A></p>		</div>	</body></html>
