				The diagram above is a road map that takes you through an e-Lab. Another
				name for the map is a <em>workflow diagram</em>. Drag your mouse over 
				the diagram.  You'll see that the circles are links. The links on the 
				ends point to the pre-test and post-test that you will take to measure 
				your e-Lab learning.  Other links represent <em>milestones</em> -- 
				tasks that you must master in order to move on. Click on a milestone 
				and you'll see a pop-up box.  The box will contain a statement of the 
				milestone, some <em>references</em> that you can use to learn how to 
				master the milestone, and a "log it!" link that takes you to your 
				electronic log book.  When you've mastered a milestone, write the 
				evidence in your log book.  Your teacher will read your entry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now you're ready to begin.  Go through the e-Lab tasks one at a time; 
				The Basics (optional), Get Started, Figure It Out and Tell Others.
