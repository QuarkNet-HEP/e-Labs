	  <p>
		  The diagram above is a road map that takes you through an e-Lab.
		  Another name for the map is a <em>workflow diagram</em>.
		  Drag your mouse over the diagram.
		  You'll see that the circles are links.
		  The links on the ends point to the pre-test and post-test that
		  you will take to measure your e-Lab learning.
		  Other links represent <em>milestones</em> -- tasks that you must
		  master in order to move on.
		  Click on a milestone and you'll see a pop-up box.
		  The box will contain a statement of the milestone,
		  some <em>references</em> that you can use to learn how to    
		  master the milestone, and a "log it!" link that takes you to your 
		  electronic log book.
		  When you've mastered a milestone, write the evidence in your log
		  book.
		  Your teacher will read your entry. 


	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Now you are ready to begin.
		  Go through the e-Lab tasks one at a time;
		  The <a href="research-basics.jsp">Basics</a> (optional),
		  Get Started, Figure It Out and Tell Others.
