The frequencies of gravitational waves are related to the movements of objects that produce them, such as black holes.  Frequencies of other waves, such as seismic waves, also are important for LIGO to measure and understand.  These waves can interfere with LIGO's ability to detect gravitational waves.</p><h2>Estimating Wave Frequencies from Graphs</h2><p>Frequency is defined as the number of times that a wave vibrates per second.  The unit of frequency is the <b>Hertz</b>.  One Hertz is one wave per second.  Hertz is abbreviated Hz.</p><p>Study the examples below to learn how to measure the frequencies of waves from voltage-vs-time graphs.  Voltage is just one of a many units that could appear on graphs such as these.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="5"><tr><td><img src="../graphics/wave_1.png" width="421" height="197"></td><td>What time is needed for one full wave cycle to occur?  From the graph we can see that the time is 0.2 sec.  This is the <i>period</i> of the wave.  To find the frequency, just take the reciprocal of the period.  (1)/(0.2) is 5.0 -- the frequency is 5.0 Hertz, or 5.0 Hz.  Another way to measure the frequency is to count the total number of wave cycles on the plot (15 cycles) and divide this by the corresponding time on the plot (3 sec).  This ratio gives the same answer of 5 Hz.</td></tr><tr><td><img src="../graphics/wave_2.png" width="421" height="197"></td><td>Here you can see that a full wave requires 1.6 sec.  This is the wave period.  The frequency is the reciprocal of 1.6, which is 0.625 Hz.  A frequency less than 1 Hz means that wave period is more than 1 sec.  Since the frequency is so low on this plot, only one wave cycle plus a fraction of another fits on the plot.</td></tr><td><img src="../graphics/wave_3.png" width="421" height="197"></td><td>This wave pattern corresponds to a very low frequency.  You can see from the plot that only 1/2 of one wave occurs in 3 sec.  The period of one full wave would be 6 sec.  The frequency would be the reciprocal of 6, or 0.167 Hz.</td></tr></table><p>To check your understanding of frequency, measure the frequencies of the waves on the following three plots.  Record your answers in a logbook entry.</p><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="5"><tr><td><img src="../graphics/wave_4.png" width="421" height="197"></td><td>What are the frequencies of the three wave patterns shown on these plots?  Record your estimates in a logbook entry.</tr><tr><td><img src="../graphics/wave_5.png" width="421" height="197"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="../graphics/wave_6.png" width="421" height="197"></td></tr></table><h2>LIGO Sorts Seismometer Data Channels by Frequencies</h2><p>When you begin using Bluestone, the LIGO seismic data plotter, you'll see that the DMT (Data Monitoring Tool) subsystem offers you a list of sensors that have labels such as <u>Seismic x, Bandwidth filtered, 0.1 - 0.3 Hz</u>.  This data channel tells you the amount of ground vibration that comes from seismic wave frequencies between 0.1 Hz and 0.3 Hz -- no other frequencies are included in this channel.  If you set your Bluestone user level to Intermediate, you'll see many more channels that correspond to different frequency ranges.  Different frequency channels are useful because many seismic events will produce waves of some frequencies but not others.</p><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="5"><tr><td><img src="../graphics/plot_4.jpg" width="487" height="330" /></td><td>Bluestone's default mode will produce a plot with one-minute averages of ground vibrations within a certain frequency band.  The plot at the left is made of 720 points.  You don't see the points -- just the curve that connects them.  The graph shows a minute-by-minute picture of the amount of ground shaking at LIGO in the 0.1 - 0.3 Hz frequency band.</td></tr></table>		<hr>		<p><a href="javascript:window.close();"><font size="-1">Close Window</A></p>		</div>	</body></html>
