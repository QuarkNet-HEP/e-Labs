     <p>The LIGO E-Lab provides an online environment in which students experience the excitement of scientific
collaboration by investigating seismic behavior.  Seismic energy from earthquakes, wind, ocean waves and human
activity will become visible and meaningful as students plot data from seismometers at LIGO Hanford Observatory </p>

     <p>Seismic processes influence the behavior of LIGO's gravitational wave detectors. Inquiry-based E-lab investigations, 
designed and conducted by students, will connect to LIGO in exciting and authentic ways.
Students will learn about LIGO's quest to detect gravitational waves as they analyze the vibrations of the ground
underneath LIGO's ultra-sensitive interferometers.</p>
