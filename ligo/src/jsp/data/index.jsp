		<h1>Data: What can you learn? Choose data and conduct a study.</h1> 
					<h2>Studies with LIGO Data</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Earthquake Studies &mdash; LIGO's seismometer data supports many research questions related to earthquakes.  Look for earthquakes in the data in LIGO's low-frequency seismic channels &mdash; 0.03 to 0.1 Hz and 0.1 Hz to 0.3 Hz.

					<li>Environment Correlation Studies &mdash; Can you see relationships between seismic activity at LIGO and other environmental influences such as rainfall, wind patterns or temperature changes?

					<li>Human Activity Studies &mdash; Can you see relationships between seismic activity at LIGO and human activities such as traffic patterns?

					<li>Microseism Studies &mdash; Ocean waves produce seismic signals in the 0.1 - 0.3 Hz band of frequencies.  Can you see relationships between ground vibrations at LIGO and wind and wave activity on the oceans?
</ul>
<p>LIGO's data analysis software, <a href="/ligo/tla/">Bluestone</a>, provides access to LIGO seismometer data plus wind, temperature and rainfall data.  
Use the 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/epic/epic.html">USGS Earthquake Archive</a> to find information on worldwide earthquakes.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">NOAA's ocean buoy network</a> to find wind and wave height data from buoys.</li></p>
</ul>
			<p>
				Bluestone allows you to select and plot data from LIGO data
		        channels, and it will eventually allow you to perform
				more complex analyses using LIGO data.
				<ul>
				<li>FIrst, take the <a href="/ligo/tla/tutorial.php">Bluestone Tutorial</a> to 
						to learn how to use this tool.
				<li>Then fire up 
				<a href="/ligo/tla/">Bluestone</a>
				as you start investigating your research question.
				<li>Once you generate a good plot, save it so you can add it to your poster.
				</ul>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Access your plots and uploaded images</h3>
			
			<ul>
								<li><a href="../plots">View Plots</a>
								- Look at what you and other groups have found!
								<li><a href="../plots/delete.jsp">Delete Plots</a>
								- Delete plots your group owns.
