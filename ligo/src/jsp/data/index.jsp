		<h1>Data: What can you learn? Choose data and conduct a study.</h1> 
					<h3>Studies with LIGO Data</h3>
				<ul style="margin-left:30px">
					<li>Earthquake Studies &mdash; LIGO's seismometer data supports many research questions related to earthquakes.  Look for earthquakes in the data in LIGO's low-frequency seismic channels &mdash; 0.03 to 0.1 Hz and 0.1 Hz to 0.3 Hz.

					<li>Environment Correlation Studies &mdash; Can you see relationships between seismic activity at LIGO and other environmental influences such as rainfall, wind patterns or temperature changes?

					<li>Human Activity Studies &mdash; Can you see relationships between seismic activity at LIGO and human activities such as traffic patterns?

					<li>Microseism Studies &mdash; Ocean waves produce seismic signals in the 0.1 - 0.3 Hz band of frequencies.  Can you see relationships between ground vibrations at LIGO and wind and wave activity on the oceans?
				</ul>
			
<h3>Access to Data (from the Navigation Bar)</h3>
<p>Use the e-Lab data interface for access to LIGO seismometer data plus wind, temperature and rainfall data. Use <b>Related Data</b> to find data from non-LIGO sources.
<h3>Access to Plots</h3>
				<ul style="margin-left:30px">
					<li><a href="../plots">View Plots</a>
					- Look at what you and other groups have found!
					<li><a href="../plots/delete.jsp">Delete Plots</a>
					- Delete plots your group owns.
