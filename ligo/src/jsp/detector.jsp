Several different types of sensors are available in the LIGO I2U2 e-lab.  Six <b>Seismometers</b> are spread across the LIGO Hanford Observatory site, one in each of the interferometer component stations and another in an underground vault next to one of the beam tube enclosures.  Each seismometer writes to three data channels corresponding to x, y and z dimensions of vibrations.  Students can plots seismometer data at one second, one minute or one hour intervals. <b>Weather Stations</b> are located on the roofs of all five interferometer buildings and contain the usual variety of waether instrumentation.  <b>Magnetometers</b> appear in several locations across the site.
