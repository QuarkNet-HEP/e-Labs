<h1>Website features that guide and support student research</h1>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
	If your students are taking the <b>pre- and post-test</b>, each member of a research group must complete the pre-test
	before they can start using the website. Then when they log in, they see the navigation bar, three quick links and the project map. 
	
</p>
<h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
<p>
	<img src="../graphics/nav.jpg"/> 
</p>
<p>
	Most of the pages also have a submenu to provide both an overview of what is 
	available and  easy access. <img src="../graphics/subnav.jpg"/>
</p>
<h2>Quick Links</h2>
<p>
 <img src="../graphics/quick-links.gif"/> 
</p>

<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Cool Science</strong> -  Who cares? An introduction to seismic data research.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Explore!</strong> -  Get comfortable!  Find out what's in the website with a graphical overview.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>About Us</strong> -  Who are we? An introduction to the collaboration.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2><strong>Project Map</strong></h2>
	
<p>	<img src="../graphics/project-map.gif"/>
<p>	Think of this map as a subway map with one main line and four branch lines.  Along the main line are stops, milestone seminars, opportunities to check how the work is going. Off each main stop are branch lines where each stop is a project milestone. The branch lines include:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>The Basics:</strong> Reviews basic research skills.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Get Started:</strong> Prepares the team to design their 
			investigation with links to information about LIGO, seismic events 
			and a research proposal.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Figure It Out:</strong> Prepares the team to ananlyze data with 
			links to how to take and upload data, use data search parameters, choose 
			analysis tools, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Tell Others:</strong> Prepares the team to enter into scientific 
			discourse. Links to how to write up investigation, create a poster and 
			comment on the work of others.
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>We provide an alternate 
	<a href="../library/milestones.jsp"><strong>text version</strong></a> for accessiblity.
</p>
<h2>Glossary and Resources</h2>
<p>
	The website has a glossary and references for the milestones 
	(accessed by clicking on the milestone in the graphical version and on the icon <img src="../graphics/ref.gif"/> in the text version). Entries show in pop-up windows 
	when a definition or reference is needed. The entire glossary is available from the Library submenu.
</p>
<h2>e-Logbook- Opportunities for Feedback</h2>
<p>
	Because this is a student-led, <b>teacher-guided</b> investigation, it is important 
	for students to get frequent feedback. 
	<p>As students work through the milestones, they have access to an online 
	logbook where they can save their notes. They can enter notes for each milestone
	 and into general notes. They can respond to teacher prompts to reflect on their progress. 
	Teachers are able to access this work, 
	track and assess student progress and provide feedback. 
	<P>Teachers also have a logbook in which they can make notes on 
	teaching strategies, resources, etc. for the next year.
	Access is through a link in upper right-hand corner on every page. 
	<img src="../graphics/logbook_link.gif"/><br/><br/>
	From their logbook,  teachers can access entries
	<ul>
		<li>
			By milestone for all their student research groups. 
			<img src="../graphics/logbook_milestone.gif"/>
		</li>
		<li>
			By student research group. <img src="../graphics/logbook_group.gif"/> 
		</li>
		<li>
			In their own logbooks with entries about each research group. 
			<img src="../graphics/logbook_my.gif"/>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2><a href="../library/resources.jsp"><strong>Resources</strong></a></h2>
<p>
	On the Library submenu is a link to references that include:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Tutorials:</strong> Step-by step instructions and tutorials for each of the studies.</li>
		<li><strong>Contacts:</strong> Experts and student research groups.</li>
		<li><strong>Online:</strong> Other URLs of interest.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2><a href="../posters/"><strong>Posters</strong></a></h2>
<p>
	Students may publish their work as a poster or a paper. We provide a webform for 
	them to enter text, select figures from the website, and coming soon uploaded 
	images of their own.
</p>
<p>
	Associated with posters are areas for comments. This allows students to comment 
	on the work of other students and ask questions.  
</p>
<h2><a href="../site-index/"><strong>Site Index</strong></a> and <a href="../site-index/site-map-anno.jsp"><strong>Site Overview</strong></a></h2>
<p>
	The student site index has a list in outline format of <strong>all the pages on this 
	site available to students</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	The student site overview provides a graphical interface to <strong> important pages on this 
	site available to students</strong>. Just roll over the main sections to see the items available for access in each section. This same interface
	is accessible from the "Explore!" quick link on the home page.  Your students may like it as an easy way to get around the website. Here the student
	has rolled over the Library and exposed the Library links.
