				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				<p>
					Students can join a scientific collaboration in this 
					series of studies of high-energy collisions from the 
					Large Hadron Collider(LHC) at CERN. We are collaborating with 
					the Compact Muon Solenoid(CMS) Collaboration. From start to finish 
					this is a student-led, teacher-guided project. At the present we 
					have test beam data for analysis. When the LHC starts producing 
					data, students will be able to request data with specific 
					parameters. By using the web and GRID computing technology students will 
					be able to analyze the data. A virtual data portal enables 
					students to share this data and associated analysis code with
					students and other researchers.
				</p>
				<p> 
					Students use a data base and analysis tool on the 
					website. The Online Graphical ROOT Environment(OGRE) is the analysis 
					tool used to analyze the data they have chosen for their study. Many 
					tutorials are available to build basic scientific skills, to explain 
					the how the detector works, to increase students understanding of 
					subatomic particles, to direct in using the analysis tools and 
					to explain how to use plots to analyze data. Students can then perform any 
					of four studies:  shower depth, lateral size, beam purity 
					or detector resolution. Students post the results of their 
					studies as online posters. Then the real scientific 
					collaboration begins. Students can review the results of other 
					studies online comparing data and analyses. Using online tools, 
					they can correspond with other research groups, post comments 
					and questions, prepare summary reports and in general, 
					participate in an aspect of scientific research that is often 
					left out of classroom experiments.

				<h2>Introduction to Research:</h2>
				<p>
					The CMS Project explores the potential 
					of using virtual data grid tools and techniques for secondary 
					science education. Like the cosmic ray e-Lab, this e-Lab 
					provides an opportunity for:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Students to do authentic research using exploratory 
							virtual data tools to access, process and publish data, report 
							and share their results as online posters, and have online 
							discussions with one another about their work.
						</li>
						<li>
							Student researchers to experience membership in a 
							scientific collaboration.
						</li>
						<li>
							Student researchers to make real contributions to the 
							study of  particle physics.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					With the CMS detector we will be studying proton-proton 
					collisions, in search of the predicted Higgs boson that may be 
					instrumental in explaining why particles have mass. Pions, 
					muons, electrons, photons, neutrinos and other particles are 
					produced in these collisions and subsequent decays. When a proton-proton collision 
					takes place, these particles interact with the detector in ways 
					particular to each particle(the particles's signature in the 
					detector).
				</p>
				<p>
					By observing how particles interact with the detector, a 
					researcher can determine which types of particles were produced 
					in the collision. Because CMS will use a much higher energy 
					beam than was previously available,  higher 
					mass particles will be able to be detected. Many top quarks 
					are expected to be seen and the predicted Higgs boson may 
					be discovered. The possibility of finding 
					particles that were previously "un-seeable" with other detectors 
					at other facilities is exciting.
				</p>	
				<h2>Prior Knowledge and Skills:</h2>
				<p>
					Before doing this project, students should know how to: 
					<ul>
						<li>Make simple measurements.</li>
						<li>Make simple calculations.</li>
						<li>Interpret simple graphs.</li>
						<li>Write a research question.</li>
						<li>Make a research plan.</li>
					</ul>

					We provide refresher references for students who need to brush up on 
					these skills. Here is what the students see: 
					<a href="research_basics.jsp">Review of Basic Skills</a>
				</p>
				
				<h2>Learner Outcomes:</h2>
				<p>
					Students will know and be able to: 
					<ul>
						<li>Content:
							<ul>
								<li>Identify particles observed in the data.</li>
								<li>Describe the role sub-detector in data analysis.</li>
								<li>Use data to measure the shape of showers produced by 
								particles.</li>
								<li>Use data to measure the detector's resolution.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Process:
							<ul>
								<li>Gather/use scientific data to identify particles.</li>
								<li>Demonstrate skills using the internet, web and virtual 
								data techniques.</li>
								<li>Work collaboratively with students in other research 
								groups.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Research Question:</h2>
				<p>
					What kinds of particles are produced in the 
					proton-proton collisions inside the CMS detector? What are the 
					smallest known particles? Is there a Higgs boson? What causes 
					objects to have mass? Students can pose a number of questions 
					and then analyze the data for answers. Some answers are new to 
					students but well answered by physicists. These include the 
					smallest known particles, the kinds of particles that are 
					produced in proton-proton collisions and how these produced 
					particles interact with the detector. However, the cause of mass 
					is an open question that the CMS Collaboration hopes to address. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Students may be able to contribute insights to these efforts. 
					Many experiments have been investigating the smallest particles. 
					For example, the top quark was discovered at the accelerator at 
					Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory by the CDF and D0 collaborations. Students will be able 
					to see the results of other researchers in this field. At this 
					time student will be looking at test beam data which will help 
					them understand how particles interact  with the detector. When the LHC 
					comes on line, students will be a part of this ongoing research 
					by analyzing data and sharing it with a collaboration of their 
					peers.
				</p>
  
				<h2>Assessment:</h2>
				<p>
					Asssessment is aligned to learner outcomes.  We provide the
					following tools to meet specific outcomes for your students.
					You may wish to modify some to meet your needs.
