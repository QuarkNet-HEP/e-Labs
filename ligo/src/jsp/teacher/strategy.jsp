					e-Labs are independent student investigations. Teachers need to 
					manage the execution of e-Labs in a way that grants students a 
					reasonable level of independence while maintaining a reasonable 
					level of order. Some items for teacher consideration:
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							Are there enough computers available for students to work 
							individually at workstations? If not, will you have the 
							students work together, perhaps in pairs, or will you 
							pursue another strategy such as having some students work 
							on e-Labs while others undertake a different activity?
						</li>
						<li>
							What short-term checks of student progress can you develop
							that will hold students accountable for their use of time?
						</li>
						<li>
							How much course time can you devote to e-Labs? Will this 
							be continuous time or will e-Labs be interspersed with 
							other couresework?
						</li>
						<li>
							How can you tie e-Labs into a science course so that the 
							e-Labs naturally support your larger course objectives?
						</li>
					</ul>
