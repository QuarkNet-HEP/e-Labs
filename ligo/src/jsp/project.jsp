an opportunity for students to bring the scientific method to life.
Students will analyze authentic data, develop hypotheses about the
data, test their hypotheses and share their results by making and
discussing posters. The I2U2 program allows students to practice the
same methods and habits that professional scientists use every day. </font>
            <p><font face="ARIAL">All that's needed for I2U2 is a
computer, an internet connection and access to the I2U2 Web pages
through a password-protected account. Teachers and students will not
need to download software. LIGO's I2U2 data analysis tool runs on a
server. Ultimately all of the I2U2 applications will run on the Grid --
a national network of large computer clusters that are linked together
to form a single enormous computing environment.</font></p>
            <p><font face="ARIAL">LIGO environmental sensors such as
seismometers run constantly, delivering data to an acquisition system
that distributes and archives the data within LIGO's networks. A subset
of this environmental data will eventually migrate to the Grid where
students with proper access will analyze it using a Grid-based data
analysis tool.</font></p>
            <p><font face="ARIAL">The LIGO e-lab is designed for high
school students who might be studying earth science, physical science
or physics. The LIGO data analysis tool runs at beginner, intermediate
and advanced levels. As students grow in their ability to conduct
investigations, the user level allows them to advance to more
sophisticated research questions. </font> <font face="ARIAL">&nbsp;</font>
