Measuring involves:<UL><LI><B>Choosing system:</B> <BR>For example, meters or feet (SI or British).<P>Know which quantities are fundamental and which derived: If you can measure it directly, it is fundamental. Other quantities are derived from the fundamental measurements.   <P STYLE="margin-left: 10px">An example: <BR>Velocity depends on length and time; if you don't have a "velocity-o-meter," then you must measure the length and the time to calculate the velocity.  Thus, length and time are fundamental; velocity is derived.  <P>Within the SI system some fundamental units are: length (m), mass (kg), time (s). Another fundamental measurement occurs in all systems: counting the number of events, for example, how many raindrops fell at Fermilab yesterday, but has no units.  <P><LI><B>Using measuring instruments:</B> <BR>Choose appropriate instruments or tools. For example, you can't measure length with a thermometer.  (Da!)<P>Make sure you know how to read the numbers on the instrument.<P>Calibrate the instrument (zero point).  You've got to know the starting point to take a measurement. <P><LI><B>Taking measurements & logging numbers on raw data table:</B>  <BR>Reading the instrument takes practice and an understanding of the mechanics of the instrument.  <P>Set up a data table.<P>Record fundamental data as you take it. Don't try to remember for later; that's when mistakes are made and data lost.  <P><LI><B>Assessing the errors in the measurements: </B> <P><B>Every measurement ever taken contains errors.</B><BR> Consideration of error may affect the instrument you choose. Measuring the thickness of a piece of paper with a meter stick would cause huge errors; using a micrometer enables more refined data.<P><LI><B>Determining the accuracy & precision of measurements:</B>   <BR>Knowing if a measurement is accurate requires knowing "a priori" (that's Latin for "knowing before the experiment") the correct answer.  Hmmm? How can you know the correct measurement before you've taken the measurement?  Well, that's when theory and modeling come into play.  With theory, you make a prediction of what the "correct" measurement will be.  This could be thought of as a hypothesis.</UL><P>	<B>An Example:</B> <BR>Let's measure the size of your desk using a meter stick.  Most meter sticks have spacing of 1 mm.  Thus, the closest you can measure is to the nearest single millimeter, and then you can estimate to a 1/10th of a millimeter (if you're good!).  For discussion sake, the "zero" end of the meter stick is broken off (Uh, oh!)<BR>  No worries.<BR>Follow this simple example,<BLOCKQUOTE>To find the width of the desk place the meter stick along the front of your desk letting the broken end hang over the left edge.  This forces you to choose a starting number (because "zero" is not available).  Read the meter stick at this point, say:<BR> W<SUB>left</SUB> = 152 mm.  <BR>You read the right dimension as W<SUB>right</SUB> = 816 mm.  <BR>Obviously,<BR> W<SUB>desk</SUB> = W<SUB>right</SUB> - W<SUB>left</SUB><BR> W<SUB>desk</SUB> = 816 mm - 152 mm<BR> W<SUB>desk</SUB> = 664 mm<BR> Repeat to verify your numbers recording each trial.<BR><B>They may not be the same each time!</B><BR> Similarly, you find the length to be L<SUB>desk</SUB> = 561 mm<BR> This trivial case demonstrates each facet of taking measurements using:<UL> <LI>Fundamental units - length <LI>SI system - metric<LI>Instrument - meter stick<LI>Calibration - find the "zero" point, W<sub>left</sub> = 152 mm<LI>Taking measurements and recording the numbers - log book/data table (you did write down the data, didn't you?)<LI>Errors - repeat until confident of numbers</UL></BLOCKQUOTE><P>  <B>References</B>   <P STYLE="margin-left: 10px">  <A HREF="javascript:openPopup('http://www.batesville.k12.in.us/physics/APPhyNet/Measurement/Measurement_Intro.html','measure',800)">Science, Measurements, Errors, and Uncertainty</a> - excellent measurement overview<br> <P STYLE="margin-left: 10px">  <A HREF="javascript:openPopup('http://phoenix.phys.clemson.edu/tutorials/measure/index.html','measure',800)">Measuring Devices</a> - good pictures of scales<br>  </TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right"><HR><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</FONT></A></td></tr></table></BODY></HTML>
