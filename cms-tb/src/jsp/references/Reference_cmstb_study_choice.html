<b>Milestone: Choose a study and write a researchable question.</b>
<p>  <i>Knowing the study organizes all aspects of the project. It determines the model used to predict results. It helps determine the plan to marshal resources - time and money and equipment and manpower. Guidelines for a research proposal are well-defined by the scientific field.</i>
<p>
Once you are able to produce and interpret plots of CMS test beam data with OGRE, you can use them to ask and answer questions about both the CMS detector and the particles with which it interacts.  
<p>
How deeply does a given particle of a given energy penetrate the detector?  (That's a shower depth study).  
<br>
How much area of the detector is impacted? (Shower width or lateral width study.)    
<p>
These and two other types of studies are places to begin, but the limits are set by your own curiosity and imagination. </p>
<p>To get ideas for your study, look at the posters to see what other students have done for their research.</p>

<p>Explain any one of the four studies described in the OGRE tutorial. Then record your own study and researchable question in your logbook!
