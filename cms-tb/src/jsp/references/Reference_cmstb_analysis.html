<b>Milestone: Choose and employ appropriate analysis tools.</b>
<P><I>The e-Lab provides online analysis tools. These analyses are most likely more complex than any analyses you have done before.</i>
<p>
Computational analysis tools help you explore data more efficiently: <A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('/~ogre/',800,600)">OGRE</a> can produce plots of many thousands of data points in seconds.  These plots have many elements (such as axes, points, slope, peak height and width), all of which have numerical values, units and meaning.</p> 
<p>
Which of the kinds of plots generated by OGRE (Total Energy, ECAL Energy, etc.) will help perform your study?  Can you find what you need in a single application of an OGRE analysis tool, or will you need to produce a number of plots?  Choose your tools and go to work!</p>
