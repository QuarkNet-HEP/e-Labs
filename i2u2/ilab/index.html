								i-Labs brings the research experience to informal settings such as 
								science museums and public kiosks. To engage the general public in 
								science, we envision using appealing museum exhibits to attract 
								visitors' attentions and engage them in a short taste of 
								exploration. Because we need to reconcile a visitor's short 
								attention span at the museum with the asynchronous nature of large 
								computations, we will, where necessary, use the Internet to follow 
								up by inviting visitors to continue their scientific explorations 
								through a virtual community from their home or school. Visitors 
								will be able to learn about some of the big questions that 
								challenge scientists in a particular field of research and 
								participate in a virtual scientific collaboration. They will use 
								virtual data tools and techniques to access, process and publish 
								data, report their results as online posters, have online 
								discussions about their work with peers, and then present posters 
								and meet scientists at museums. In our ultimate vision, they will 
								be engaged to make real contributions to a scientific investigation.
							</p>

								Leading the effort to research an informal-education model, the 
								Adler Planetarium is developing a cosmic ray i-Lab with support 
								from QuarkNet and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment.
