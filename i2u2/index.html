					Interactions in Understanding The Universe, I2U2 an "educational virtual 
					organization," strengthens the education and outreach activities of 
					scientific experiments at U.S. universities and laboratories. I2U2 
					creates and maintains an infrastructure and common fabric to develop 
					hands-on laboratory course content and provide an interactive learning 
					experience that brings tangible aspects of each experiment into an 
					accessible "virtual laboratory" setting for education at different 
					levels and in various venues. The I2U2 collaboration of scientists, 
					computer scientists and educators directly addresses the urgent national 
					priority to grow and sustain the scientific workforce, and to promote 
					the public's appreciation of and support for the complex collaborations 
					of our national scientific programs.
				</p>
				<p>
					I2U2 labs take two similar but distinct shapes. "e-Labs," delivered as 
					Web-based portals accessible in the classroom and at home, are 
					implemented with the ever-expanding capabilities of Web-based media. 
					"i-Labs," delivered as interactive interfaces typically located within 
					science museums and similar public venues, leverage the latest advances 
					in display technology and human-computer interaction, and bring 
					the experiences and appreciation of scientific investigation and inquiry 
					to the wide audience of informal education. These laboratories break new 
					ground by using the Grid for education in the same way that science uses 
					the Grid. I2U2 reaches communities underrepresented in science and 
					continuously assesses the impact of this approach on science education. 
					I2U2 collaborators use existing partnerships with underserved populations 
					to prototype and evaluate the labs.
