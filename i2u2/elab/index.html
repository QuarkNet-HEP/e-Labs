					e-Labs explore the potential of using the Internet and 
					distributed computing in high school classes and 
					provide an opportunity for students to:
					<ul>
						<li>Organize and conduct authentic research.</li>
						<li>Experience the environment of scientific collaborations.</li>
						<li>Possibly to make real contributions to a burgeoning scientific field. </li>
					</ul>
					<strong>If you're a science teacher</strong>, we've created projects 
					that are problem-based, student driven and technology dependent. 
					Students reach beyond classroom walls to explore data with other 
					students and experts and share results, publishing original work to 
					a world-wide audience. Students can discover and extend the research 
					of other students, modeling the processes of modern, large-scale 
					research projects.
				</p> 
				<p>
					From start to finish e-Labs are student-led, teacher-guided projects. 
					Students need only a web-browser to access distributed computing techniques employed 
					by professional researchers. A Project Map with milestones allows 
					<em>students</em> to set the research plan rather than follow a 
					step-by-step process common in other online projects. Most 
					importantly e-Labs build the learning experience around the students' 
					own questions and let them use the very tools that scientists use.
				</p> 
				<p>
					<strong>e-Labs differ</strong> from other collaborative education 
					environments because they build on the power of distributed computing and the 
					Virtual Data System to add exciting education components not available 
					with other models. Students contribute to and access shared data, most 
					derived from professional research databases. They use common analysis 
					tools, store their work and <B>use metadata to discover, replicate and 
					confirm the research of others.</B> This is where real scientific 
					collaboration begins. Using online tools, students correspond with 
					other research groups, post comments and questions, prepare summary 
					reports, and in general participate in the part of scientific research 
					that is often left out of classroom experiments.
				</p> 
				<p>
					Teaching tools such as student and teacher logbooks, pre- and post-tests 
					and an assessment rubic aligned with learner outcomes help teachers 
					guide student work. Constraints on interface designs and administrative 
					tools such as registration databases give teachers the "one-stop-shopping" 
					they seek for multiple e-Labs. Teaching and administrative tools also 
					allow us to track usage and assess the impact on student learning.
