# These are the steps required to start Moodle installation from scratch,
# using MySQL database on the local machine.  For variations and
# details see  http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle
#
# Most of the Moodle configuration is done via web server the first
# time you connect to the new site, so this is just what I did to
# get it running on the web server, to prime the pump.
#
# Requirements:  
#		 1) Apache web server
#                2) MySQL database server
#		 3) PHP support (though not to run this script)

# Top level directory for the site installation:
#
MOODLE_TOP_DIR="/opt/moodle"  

# File upload directory (should not be served to web!)
#
MOODLE_UPLOAD_DIR="/opt/moodle/upload"

# Database name, username, and password  (don't leave password in view)
#
MOODLE_DB_NAME="moodle"
MOODLE_DB_USER="moodler"
MOODLE_DB_PASS="XXXXXXX"

# Apache configuration. We put site configuration in
#   this file, and the httpd.conf either has to Include it, or
#   you have to make some other arrangements to add it to the config.
#  (My httpd.conf loads all *.conf files from conf/local.d/ )
#   Edit the file APACHE_CONF after it's created.

#
APACHE_CONF_DIR="/usr/local/apache/conf/local.d"
APACHE_USER="apache"
