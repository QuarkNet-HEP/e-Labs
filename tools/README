This directory contains software tools used in support of the I2U2
web site and analysis tools.

The scripts build_* contain instructions for building the software.
They are usually just invocations to ./configure with the proper
flags, followed by `make` and perhaps `make test`.

The scripts deploy-* contain instructions for deploying different
software components onto a server.

Note that scripts which begin #!/bin/human *might* work if you run
them through bash, but maybe not.   They are intended to be an outline
of the steps I took, not necessarily automated scripts for every 
occasion.  (But in fact I ran them to do my builds, so there.)
