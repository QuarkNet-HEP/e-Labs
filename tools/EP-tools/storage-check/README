This tool keeps track of how much we are storing in the /disks folder.
I added it to the cronjob so it runs daily:

# Run python code to get size of /disks daily so we can find out growth rate
 0 0 * * * python /home/quarkcat/tools/storage-check/calculate_data_growth.py > /tmp/data-growth.log 2>&1

the output should be in a file in the same folder:
data_growth.txt

Questions?
