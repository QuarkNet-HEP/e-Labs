I tested the tool from home and it works. I recall running it from Fermilab weeks ago and it used to work but I believe I was using the wireless connection vs this week that I was connected to the network using the wire (?). Anyway, try it and let me know.

Instructions:
--all the files in these folder should be compressed and named i2u2-automated-test.zip--
1-unzip the compressed file in your machine
2-check the path because you will need to modify “runtest.sh”.

For example: I download this zip to my /users/edit and unzip it. All the files are now in /users/edit/i2u2-automated-test/*
cd to that path and edit the runtest.sh where you find these lines:

export JUNIT_HOME=/users/edit/i2u2-automated-test/junit
export JUNIT_LIBS=/users/edit/i2u2-automated-test/lib

The paths need to reflect the paths in your machine. Save.

3-Then, within the folder run:

source runtest.sh 

If you see output like the following, it means it worked and all the tests you see output for were successful. If it doesn’t, send me an email with your output.

source runtest.sh
:/users/edit/i2u2-automated-test/junit/*:.:/users/edit/i2u2-automated-test/lib/*:.
