Split.pl does not clean up after trying to split and failing so it creates a split file and a .bless in the detector folder but it does not create any metadata for these files. These can be easily checked out through the application but a faster way to find them is to check if each split has a .thresh file associated with it.

To check if there are split files without .thresh:

For production, run:
   python thresh_check_18.py

This generates an output file that will list all the files at 
   /disks/i2u2/cosmic/data/etc
that do not have a .thresh file

For development, run:
   python thresh_check_13.py

Also, I got tired of moving these files manually to a ~/cosmic/.Trash folder manually so now I run:
For production:
   python remove_orphans_18.py

For development:
   python remove_orphans_13.py

This process moves this orphans files to the .Trash folder where they will stay until I zip them or delete them for good. Nobody misses these files ;)

Questions?
