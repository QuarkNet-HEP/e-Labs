# Proxy e-Labs and i-Labs and other things to Tomcat on port 8080,

# Ideally, the user does not know or care which stuff comes from Tomcat/JSP

# Turn off FORWARD proxy (we just use a reverse proxy, also called a gateway) 

ProxyRequests Off

# Configure how response headers are passed through the proxy

ProxyPassReverse  /		http://localhost:8080/


# Use this when we have DNS load balancing to www.i2u2.org
#ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain   localhost  www.i2u2.org


# Configure what comes from Tomcat (on port 8080) and what is served
# by Apache directly (or via PHP).   In general you want to turn off
# proxying first (with !) and then specify the things that are proxied.
