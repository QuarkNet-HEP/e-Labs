# worth of logs, used for generating the main HTML page (index.html).

# DNSCache specifies the DNS cache filename to use for reverse DNS lookups.
# This file must be specified if you wish to perform name lookups on any IP
# addresses found in the log file. 
#
# NB. must have db-devel installed to use this and GeoIP

DNSCache	/var/lib/webalizer/dns_cache.db

# GeoDB enables GeoIP service to map IP address into a geographic 
# location.  

GeoDB yes

# The Quiet option suppresses output messages.

Quiet		yes


# TimeMe allows you to force the display of timing information
# at the end of processing.  

TimeMe		no

# GMTTime allows reports to show GMT (UTC) time instead of local
# time.  Default is to display the time the report was generated
# in the timezone of the local machine, such as EDT or PST.  This
# keyword allows you to have times displayed in UTC instead.  Use
# only if you really have a good reason, since it will probably
# screw up the reporting periods by however many hours your local
# time zone is off of GMT.

GMTTime		yes

# FoldSeqErr forces the Webalizer to ignore sequence errors.
# The Apache HTTP server may generate out-of-sequence log entries
# so this option is enabled.

FoldSeqErr	yes

# VisitTimeout allows you to set the default timeout for a visit
# (sometimes called a 'session').  The default is 30 minutes,
# which should be fine for most sites.
# Visits are determined by looking at the time of the current
# request, and the time of the last request from the site.  If
# the time difference is greater than the VisitTimeout value, it
# is considered a new visit, and visit totals are incremented.
# Value is the number of seconds to timeout (default=1800=30min)

#VisitTimeout	1800

# GraphLines allows you to have index lines drawn behind the graphs.

GraphLines	3

# The "Top" options below define the number of entries for each table.

# The All* keywords allow the display of all URL's, Sites, Referrers
# User Agents, Search Strings and Usernames.  If enabled, a seperate
# HTML page will be created, and a link will be added to the bottom
# of the appropriate "Top" table.  There are a couple of conditions
# for this to occur.  Please be aware that these pages can
# be quite large in size, particularly the sites page,  and seperate
# pages are generated for each month, which can consume quite a lot
# of disk space depending on the traffic to your site.

AllSites	yes
AllURLs		yes

AllAgents	yes
#AllUsers       no



######################################################################
# The Hide*, Group* and Ignore* and Include* keywords allow you to
# change the way Sites, URL's, Referrers, User Agents and Usernames
# are manipulated.  The Ignore* keywords will cause The Webalizer to
# completely ignore records as if they didn't exist (and thus not
# counted in the main site totals).  The Hide* keywords will prevent
# things from being displayed in the 'Top' tables, but will still be
# counted in the main totals.  The Group* keywords allow grouping
# similar objects as if they were one.  Grouped records are displayed
# in the 'Top' tables and can optionally be displayed in BOLD and/or
# shaded. Groups cannot be hidden, and are not counted in the main
# totals. The Group* options do not, by default, hide all the items
# that it matches.  If you want to hide the records that match (so just
# the grouping record is displayed), follow with an identical Hide*
# keyword with the same value.  (see example below)  In addition,
# Group* keywords may have an optional label which will be displayed
# instead of the keywords value.  The label should be seperated from
# the value by at least one 'white-space' character, such as a space
# or tab.
#
# The value can have either a leading or trailing '*' wildcard
# character.  If no wildcard is found, a match can occur anywhere
# in the string. Given a string "www.yourmama.com", the values "your",
# "*mama.com" and "www.your*" will all match.

# The MangleAgents allows you to specify how much, if any, The Webalizer
# should mangle user agent names.  This allows several levels of detail
# to be produced when reporting user agent statistics.  There are six
# levels that can be specified, which define different levels of detail
# supression.  Level 5 shows only the browser name (MSIE or Mozilla)
# and the major version number.  Level 4 adds the minor version number
# (single decimal place).  Level 3 displays the minor version to two
# decimal places.  Level 2 will add any sub-level designation (such
# as Mozilla/3.01Gold or MSIE 3.0b).  Level 1 will attempt to also add
# the system type if it is specified.  The default Level 0 displays the
# full user agent field without modification and produces the greatest
# amount of detail.  User agent names that can't be mangled will be
# left unmodified.

MangleAgents    1


# The SearchEngine keywords allow specification of search engines and
# their query strings on the URL.  These are used to locate and report
# what search strings are used to find your site.  The first word is
# a substring to match in the referrer field that identifies the search
# engine, and the second is the URL variable used by that search engine
# to define it's search terms.

# Max string size is 80 characters.  Use multiple lines if you need to.

#HTMLPost 	<BR CLEAR="all">

# HTMLTail defines the HTML code to insert at the bottom of each

# Dump*
#
# The Dump* keywords allow the dumping of Sites, URL's, Referrers
# User Agents, Usernames and Search strings to seperate tab delimited
# text files, suitable for import into most database or spreadsheet
# programs.

# DumpPath specifies the path to dump the files.  If not specified,
# it will default to the current output directory.  Do not use a
# trailing slash ('/').

DumpPath	/home/i2u2/boinc/html/ops/usage/dump

# The DumpHeader keyword specifies if a header record should be
# written to the file.  A header record is the first record of the
# file, and contains the labels for each field written.  Normally,
# files that are intended to be imported into a database system
# will not need a header record, while spreadsheets usually do.
# Value can be either 'yes' or 'no', with 'no' being the default.

DumpHeader	yes

# DumpExtension allow you to specify the dump filename extension
# to use.  The default is "tab", but some programs are pickey about
# the filenames they use, so you may change it here (for example,
# some people may prefer to use "csv").

#DumpExtension	tab

# These control the dumping of each individual table.  The value
# can be either 'yes' or 'no'.. the default is 'no'.

DumpSites	yes
