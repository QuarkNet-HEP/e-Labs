= Where are the options? =

In the Administration panel, go under the appearance tab.  The options are under the menu named *Adv. Headers.*

= Can I still use custom headers? =

Yes! Custom headers will still be applied if you use them.  If no page specific headers exist, the plugin will show a header of your choice.

Simply don't enter a URL into the category text box and the default one will show instead.
