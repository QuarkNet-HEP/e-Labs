The Library would be a searchable relational database of on-line and
off-line resources for e-Labs and i-Labs.
It would allow participants to search for, access, index, and comment
on web pages, books, technical reports, PowerPoint presentations and
other sources relevant to e-Labs and iLabs.

<P>

The Library might be organized with separate teachers-only areas,
or the database would qualify access based on a participant's \"role\"
(teacher, student, developer,...)

<P>

A lot more discussion and planning  planning and will need to go in to 
developing this tool.   Meanwhile, we will keep a small list of
useful static links here until it gets going.
