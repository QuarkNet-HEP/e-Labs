This area could be structured to show the on-line posters created
by students who have completed e-Labs.

<P>

One important issue:  can students who are working on an e-Lab view 
the posters from previous projects on the same e-Lab.   There
are probably cases where it could go either way, so intelligent 
access controls would be needed.

<P>

There needs to be futher discussion and planning for this area.
See you in the discussion rooms...
