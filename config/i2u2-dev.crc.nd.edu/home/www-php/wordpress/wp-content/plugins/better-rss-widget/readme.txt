== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why this plugin when there is already an RSS Widget? =

At the time this plugin was created (Wordpress version 2.8.4), the built in widget did not have an option to force RSS links to open in a new window. The only way to do this was to hack into the core code of Wordpress, which is not recommended. It is hoped that eventually Wordpress will simply add this option to their widget, but until then, this becomes a quick and easy solution.

= Why do I have to check all the pages types for each widget? =

The default for the plugin is to let you choose which types of pages to display the widget on. You can change these defaults on the plugin settings page.

= I just updated to 1.0 now my widgets do not show! =

With the addition of the page conditionals, you will need to edit your widget settings to turn the widget on for each page. Sorry, there is no way for me to do this automatically. Don't forget to set your defaults on the plugin settings page for future widgets.
