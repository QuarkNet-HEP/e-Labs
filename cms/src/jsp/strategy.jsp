<P>
he very nature of the CMS Test Beam eLab is quite different 
                        from traditional labs that can be completed in a lab period or a 
                        couple of lab periods. Test Beam experiments typically require 
                        a great deal of  computer time to analyze data. Extra class time, 
                        however, is not something most teachers have in an already full 
                        course. You may also wonder how to provide each student time to 
                        do an experiment when you have only a few computers.
                      <P>These are realistic questions. Here are approaches other 
                        teachers have used. You may get some good ideas about how to 
                        incorporate these experiments into your course but also to help 
                        your students discover how particle physics experiments are 
                        really done.
                      <P><B>Individual or Small Group Long-term Integrated Project</B><BR>
                        Organize 
                        the CMS experiments as a long-term project that spans a 
                        quarter or even more. If students work on this project 
                        intermittently, you can run these CMS experiments in 
                        parallel with your "standard" curriculum with days set aside 
                        periodically for CMS eLab work.
                      <P>After an introduction to  particles, the detector and the <a href="javascript:research_questions()">research questions that physicists ask in this field</a>, have 
                        student groups write up a proposal for the study they 
                        wish to perform. These studies might include shower depth, lateral size, beam purity or detector resolution. with regard to  
                        energy of the beam(50GeV) electrons or with regard to a particular particle (pions)
                      <P>Groups can analyze their data and visit the 
                        "Poster" section of the CMS eLab to research 
                        the results of other student groups. Having your students 
                        post their work here and/or having them give oral presentations 
                        (sometimes with guest physicists!) may make for a great summary 
                        to the project.

                      <P><B>Collaborative Group Project</B></P>
                      <P>Organize 
                        the CMS experiments as a short-term class collaborative project that spans a 
                        few class periods. If students work on this project 
                        collaboratively, you can run these CMS experiments in a few days as part of your "standard" curriculum with days set aside 
                        for CMS eLab work. Each of these studies are lengthy. Working in groups may reduce the time needed to complete a study. </P>

                        energy of the beam(50GeV) electrons or with regard to a particular particle (pions).
                      <P>Divide the study into smaller tasks.  Below are some divisions which can be made:

                      <p>You may wish to assign each group a single particle (e.g. electron, pion or muon).  For even smaller task you may wish to assign each group a single particle at a single energy (electrons at 5o GeV). after their groups have finished their task they can prepare a report(written or oral ) for their colleagues, the remainder of the class. White board or poster presentations for each group are often effective here. </p>
