<b>Milestone: Describe the physics questions that CMS is designed to address.</b>
<P><i>Scientists begin with carefully refined questions that shape their investigations.</i></p>
<P>
The CMS Collaboration has designed their detector precisely to advance the search for answers to a particular set of physics questions. Begin to know the CMS detector, by getting to know these questions.</p>

<P>Answer the following questions in your logbook:
Describe three or more physics questions CMS scientists hope to answer. Go a step further: describe at least one way that CMS detector characteristics are shaped by the physics questions the collaboration is investigating.
