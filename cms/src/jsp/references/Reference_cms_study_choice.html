<b>Milestone: Select a research question to ask of CMS test beam data.</b><p>  <i>Once you are able to produce and interpret graphs of CMS testbeam data with OGRE, you can use them to ask and answer questions about both the CMS detector and the particles with which it interacts.  How deeply does a given particle of a given energy penetrate the detector?  (That?s a Shower Depth study).  How much area of the detector is impacted? (Shower Width.)    These and two other types of studies are suggested as places to begin, but the limits are set by your own curiosity and imagination.</i> </p>  Explain any one of the four studies described in the OGRE tutorial. Then choose your own study! <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../jsp/logEntry.jsp?keyword=cms_study_choice',700,600)"><b>Log it!</b><IMG SRC="../graphics/logbook_pencil.gif" border="0"  align="middle"></A>
