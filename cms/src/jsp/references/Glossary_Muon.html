<strong>Muon</strong>
<p>
The muon (from the Greek letter &mu;) is an elementary particle similar to but much more massive than the electron. 
The muon has electric charge -1 and a spin 1/2; an antimuon is the same but with charge +1. 
The muon is classified, with  the electron, the tau, and the neutrinos, as a lepton. Leptons are fundamental particles 
that do not interact via the strong force.<br />
