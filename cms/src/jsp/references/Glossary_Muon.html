<strong>Muon</strong>
<p>
The muon (from the Greek letter mu (&mu; or &mu;-) used to represent it) is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with negative electric charge and a spin of 1Ú2. 
Together with the electron, the tauon, and the three neutrinos, it is classified as a lepton. An antimuon (&mu;+) has positive charge. 
The combination of two muons is called a dimuon. The Z boson can decays into dimuons. 
Physicsts can determine the mass of the Z boson by measuring the mass of the resultant dimuons.
