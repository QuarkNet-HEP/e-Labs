<b>Milestone: Apply appropriate analysis tool.</b>
<P><I>Scientists employ computational analysis tools to process data more efficiently.</i>
<p>Computational analysis tools produce plots of many thousands of data points in fractions of a second. These plots have many elements (such as axes, points, slope, peak height and width), all of which have numerical values, units and meaning.
</p>      
<P>
Create a plot!</p>   
<P>
There's a lot you can do with your plot. Check the plot parameters to:
<ul>
<li>Zoom in on parts of the plot by dragging across a selection and clicking "Apply."
<li>For histograms:<br>
<ul><li>Build the plot event-by-event with the animation tool.
<li>Set maximum y values.
<li>Change the bin width.
</ul>
<li>Save your plot to use in a poster.
</ul></p>
<P>Can you find what you need in a single application of the analysis tool, or will you need to produce a number of plots? 
<p>
Keep track of your different analyses in your logbook. </P>
