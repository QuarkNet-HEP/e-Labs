<b>Milestone: Choose and employ appropriate analysis tools.</b><P>      <I>Computational analysis tools help you explore data more efficiently: OGRE can produce plots of many thousands of data points in seconds.  These plots have many elements (such as axes, points, slope, peak highth and width), all of which have numerical values, units, and meaning. Which of the kinds of plots generated by OGRE (Total Energy, ECAL Energy, etc.) will help answer the research question you are asking of the data?  Can you find what you need in a single application of an OGRE analysis tool, or will you need to produce a number of plots?  Do you need additional computational tools (like Excel or Graphical Analysis) to present and interpret your results from OGRE?  Choose your tools, and go to work!</I>       <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../jsp/logEntry.jsp?keyword=cms_analysis',700,600)"><b>Log it!</b><IMG SRC="../graphics/logbook_pencil.gif" border="0"  align="middle"></A>  <P> <B>References</B>
