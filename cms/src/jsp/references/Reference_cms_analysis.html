<b>Milestone: Choose and employ appropriate analysis tools.</b>
<P><I>Scientists employ computational analysis tools to process data more efficiently.</i>
<p>
OGRE produces plots of many thousands of data points in seconds. These plots have many elements (such as axes, points, slope, peak height and width), all of which have numerical values, units and meaning.<p>
<p>Which OGRE plots will help you find evidence for your research question? Can you find what you need in a single application of an OGRE analysis tool, or will you need to produce a number of plots? Choose your tools and go to work!</p>
