<b>Milestone: Choose and employ appropriate analysis tools.</b>
<P><I>Scientists employ computational analysis tools to process data more efficiently.</i>
<p>Computational analysis tools produce plots of many thousands of data points in fractions of a second. These plots have many elements (such as axes, points, slope, peak height and width), all of which have numerical values, units and meaning.
</p>      
<P>
Which plot types will help you find evidence for your research question? Can you find what you need in a single application of the analysis tool, or will you need to produce a number of plots? Choose your tools and go to work!
</p>      
<P>Keep track of your different analyses in your logbook.</P>
