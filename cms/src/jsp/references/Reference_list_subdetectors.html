<b>Milestone: List each CMS subdetector, in order, and explain that order in terms of the properties of particles each detects.</b>
<P><i>Scientists design and deploy instruments guided by the questions they are asking and the nature and cost of materials available to them.</i></p>
<P>The CMS detector is a complex instrument, designed to address big science questions you’ve explored, based on particle properties to which you’ve been introduced, and limited by the properties of measurement materials and technology. CMS is composed of subdetectors, and to interpret the data produced by the detector as a whole, you need to know about its parts and their place in the whole.</p>
<P>Get to know the subdetectors, their order and their roles in the references below and this <a href="javascript:showRefLink('http://cms.web.cern.ch/cms/Resources/Website/Media/Videos/Animations/files/CMS_Slice.swf',700,550)">interactive graphic</a>. </p>
<P>Answer the following questions in your logbook:</p>
<p>
Present the CMS subdetectors in order, beginning from nearest to the beam pipe.  Why does the order of these subdetectors matter? Give at least two examples of why it would not work to change the order, and explain each example making reference properties of the particles each detects.
