<b>Milestone: Describe physics questions that CMS is designed to address.</b>
<P><i>Scientific research involves observing nature to learn new facts or test applications of theories to known facts. 
Scientists begin with carefully refined questions that shape their investigations.</i></p>

<P>In your logbook:
<ul>
	<li>Briefly describe three or more physics questions CMS scientists hope to answer.</li>
	<li>Describe at least one way the physics questions shape the CMS experiment.</li>
</ul>
</p>

This is the dawn of an exciting age of new discovery. The current theoretical framework of the fundamental nature of matter, 
known as the Standard Model, explains much, but leaves many unanswered questions. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider 
(LHC) holds the potential to answer some of these questions.
