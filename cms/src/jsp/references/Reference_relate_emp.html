"<b>Milestone: Relate energy, mass and momentum and explain the role of conservation of mass/energy, momentum and charge in analyzing CMS events.</b>
<P><i>Science builds on the application of well-established concepts to new areas of inquiry.</i></p>
<P>Conservation of Energy/Mass and of Momentum are fundamental concepts in physics. In particle physics, the near-light speeds of colliding and emerging particles bring Relativity into the picture as well. At CMS, these fundamental physics concepts are involved in event analysis.</p>
<P><a href="javascript:showRefLink('../library/ref-mass-energy-momentum.jsp',700,700)">Mass, Energy and Momentum at CMS</a> - Learn how conservation laws apply in the collisions CMS detects. </p>
<P>In your logbook:</p>
<ul>
<li>State in your own words the conservation laws for energy, momentum and charge.
<P><li>Discuss what can happen to the rest energy of particles that undergo decay; a complete discussion will invoke appropriate conservation rules.
</ul>
