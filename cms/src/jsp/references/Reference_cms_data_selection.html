<b>Milestone: Select appropriate data from the data set.</b>
<P>      
<I>Scientists need data to answer their research questions.</i>
<p>First you need to choose your data. But which data? Your research question will guide you. Exploring the available data may lead you to refine or revise your study.  </p>
<p>CMS data comes in runs of varying length and consists of events. Physicists filter the data so they can look at specific event types (e.g., events with two muons).
</p>
<p>Choose the event type you are studying. Run Selection and Advanced Data Selection allows you to display and refine your selection.</p>
