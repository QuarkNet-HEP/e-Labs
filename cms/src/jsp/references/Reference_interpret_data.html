<b>Milestone: : Interpret data.</b>
<P><i>Scientists often represent their data graphically. </i> </p>
You have already learned about particles that interact with the CMS detector. Physicists call the interaction an event. Physicists look at these events in data displays either as single or multiple events. Each approach yields important information. The plots below represent the two approaches. Click the plots to learn more about each approach.</p>

<P>In your logbook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the characteristics that indicate a Z particle has decayed to two electrons, two muons, and two jets in LEP events.  List any characteristics common to all three types of decay.

<li>Identify the CMS detector subsystems (trackers, electron and hadron calorimeters and muon chambers) involved in the detection of the dielectron, dimuon and dijet Z decays.
<li>Describe what physicists can discover when they combine millions of events.

</ul>
