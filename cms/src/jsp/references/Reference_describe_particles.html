<b>Milestone: Describe the particles colliding inside the CMS detector and those predicted by the Standard Model to emerge from the collisions.</b>
<P><i>Scientists test and refine theories by applying them in new contexts through a process of prediction and subsequent confirmation, refinement or refutation.</i> </p>
<P>
The Standard Model is the current theoretical framework of particles and their interactions. The LHC with its detectors, including CMS, provide an opportunity to put the Standard Model to a new set of tests at higher energies than ever before.</p>
<p>The references below provide an introduction to the particles colliding in the LHC and measured directly or indirectly by CMS.</p>
<P>Answer the following questions in your logbook:</p>

What particles interact in the primary collisions CMS will study?
What particles actually collide, which particles does the Standard Model predict will emerge from those primary collisions, and which particles does CMS actually detect?
