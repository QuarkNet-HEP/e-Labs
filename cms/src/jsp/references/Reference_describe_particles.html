<b>Milestone: Describe the particles interacting in the CMS detector.</b>
<P><i>Scientists often explain the behavior of complex systems in terms of the interactions among less complex parts.</i> </p>
<P>
The protons colliding in the LHC are made up of simpler parts, and so are some of the particles interacting with the CMS detector. Other interactions take place in the time between the primary collision and these direct detections. To appreciate the events produced in the LHC and detected by the CMS detector, you've got to know the cast of characters: the fundamental particles, and the more complex particles they form.</p>

<p>Read <a href="javascript:showRefLink('/library/kiwi.php/CMS_Primary_Collisions',700,550)">this introduction</a>  to the types of primary collisions in the LHC, and to the Feynman Diagrams that physicists use to depict them. The references below provide some additional background on the particles colliding in the LHC and measured directly or indirectly by CMS.</p>

<P>Answer the following questions in your logbook:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discuss the properties of the proton and how those determine the primary interactions in the LHC beam pipe.
<li>List particles that interact with each of these CMS sub-detectors: trackers, electron calorimeter, hadron calorimeter, muon chamber.
<li>Describe the ways that particles not directly observed can still be indirectly detected CMS data.
<li>Draw and upload to your logbook a Feynman diagram for the interaction of some quark-antiquark pair producing a Z which then decays to two muons.
</ul>
