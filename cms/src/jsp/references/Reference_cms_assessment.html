<b>Milestone: Review, explain and assess your results.</b>

<P><I>Collecting and running analyses are only part of "figuring it out." Before scientists publish results, they review their results to be confident  they are making the strongest case to support their ideas.</i></p>
<p>
Make sense of your plots. 
<UL>
<LI>Can you explain what they are telling you about the behavior of particles in the CMS detector?  
<LI>Do they support and answer your study questions?  
<LI>Is it an answer you expected?  (Why, or why not?) 
<LI>Are your results sufficient to support a conclusion?  
<LI>Are there further studies you could run that would test your emerging conclusion? 
</UL>
Discuss these questions among your group members and then with people outside of your group until you are satisfied that you are ready to defend your conclusion publicly. </I>
