<b>Milestone: : Interpret basic event displays.</b>
<P><i>Scientists often represent their data graphically . . </i> </p>
<P>
You have already learned about particles that interact with the CMS detector. Physicists call the interaction an event. How do these events appear in the data displays?</p>

<table width="380" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><a   href="javascript:showRefLink('../graphics/single-event.png',641,641)"><img src="../graphics/single-event-tn.png"></a></td><td><p> <b>Single event displays</b> are a great way to take a look. Click on this CMS single event to see more detail.

<p>Right away, you might wish for something simpler to get you oriented.
Watch this <a href="
javascript:showRefLink('http://screencast.com/t/NTA2ODBiZTI',625,675)">screencast</a> explaining single event displays from one of CMS' predecessor experiments, Delphi at the LEP collider. Then consider the implications of the greater collision energies at the LHC: the Z decay products do not seem to be back-to-back, nor are they the only collision products in the event, as you can see in the image above. In the next milestone, we'll consider why the greater collision energies at the LHC produce more complicated events, but for now now, just recognize that they are more complex.</p>
<p>Now, it's your turn to <a href="
javascript:showRefLink('http://ed.fnal.gov/work/i2u2/particle-id/cms_game.html',865,675)">identify CMS events</a>!

<p>Next, interact with <a href="javascript:showRefLink('../event-display/',900,900)">CMS events in 3-D</a>! They are a bit more complex, but they help you get better oriented to the whole detector and the particles it detects.</p>

<P>Answer these questions in your logbook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the common characteristics of Z decays to dielectron, dimuon, and dijet decay products in LEP events.
<li>Identify the CMS detector subsystems (trackers, electron and hadron calorimeters, and the muon chambers) involved in the detection of each of the dielectron, dimuon and dijet Z decay types.
<LI>Sketch or upload an image of some same type (e.g., dimuon) of Z decay from both LEP and LHC collisions. Using these images, describe how CMS single event displays are more complicated than Delphi single event displays.
</ul>
