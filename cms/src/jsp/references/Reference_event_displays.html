<b>Milestone: : Interpret basic event displays.</b>
<P><i>Scientists often represent their data graphically . . </i> </p>
<P>
You have already learned about particles that interact with the CMS detector. Physicists call the interaction an event. How do these events appear in the data displays?</p>

<table width="380" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><a   href="javascript:showRefLink('../graphics/single-event.png',641,641)"><img src="../graphics/single-event-tn.png"></a></td><td><p> <b>Single event displays</b> are a great way to take a look. Click on this CMS single event to see more detail.
</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Right away, you might wish for something simpler to get you oriented.
Try this screencast (LINK) of a single event display from one of CMS' predecessor experiments, Delphi.</p>
<p>Now, identify CMS events. Read particle graffiti! (LINK).

<p>Now interact with <a href="javascript:showRefLink('../event-display/',900,900)">CMS events in 3-D</a>! They are a bit more complex, but they help you get better oriented to the whole detector and the particles it detects.</p>

<P>Answer these questions in your logbook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain why CMS single event displays are more complicated than Delphi single event displays.
<li>In a two-body decay, explain the relationship among the masses of the two stable particles and the particle that produced them.
</ul>
