<b>Milestone: : Interpret basic event displays.</b>
<P><i>Scientists often represent their data graphically . . </i> </p>
<P>
You have already learned about particles that interact with the CMS detector. Physicists call the interaction an event. How do these events appear in data displays?</p>

<table width="300" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><a   href="javascript:showRefLink('../graphics/single-event.png',641,641)"><img src="../graphics/single-event-tn.png"></a></td><td><p> <b>2-D single event displays</b> are a great way to take a look. Click on this image to see the CMS Z decay.

<p>
Watch a <a href="
javascript:showRefLink('http://screencast.com/t/NTA2ODBiZTI',625,675)">screencast</a> of clean Z decays at lower energy from an earlier CERN experiment.</p>

<p>With greater collision energies at the LHC, the Z decay will not be the only collision products in the event nor will the decay products seem to be back-to-back. </p>
<p><a href="
javascript:showRefLink('http://ed.fnal.gov/work/i2u2/particle-id/cms_game.html',865,675)">2-D event display game</a> - Test your skill identifying CMS events!

<p>Try a  <a href="javascript:showRefLink('../event-display/',1150,775)">3-D</a> view? (non-Internet Explorer browsers only)
<a href="javascript:showRefLink('../video/demo-3d.html',1150,800)">Need help</a>?</p>

<p>The 3-D view is complex! Try rotating and turning parts of the detector and event off and on. You should become more familiar with the detector and the events. Pretty cool!</>


<P>In your logbook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the characteristics that indicate a Z particle has decayed to two electrons, two muons, and two jets in LEP events.  List any characteristics common to all three types of decay.
<p>
<li>Identify the CMS detector subsystems (trackers, electron and hadron calorimeters and muon chambers) involved in the detection of the dielectron, dimuon and dijet Z decays.

</ul>
