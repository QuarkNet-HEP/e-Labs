<b>Milestone: Design a study to answer your own specific research question.</b>
<p>  <i>Scientists advance toward answers to very large questions by first asking a series of smaller ones.</i>
<p>
Now that you've grasped the big picture and some fundamental physics behind the CMS experiment, you can begin asking some smaller questions of your own.  We've provided the same data and analysis tools that CMS scientists use in an special interface called <b>OGRE</b>, the Online Graphical Root Environment.  
<p>
Explore <a href="javascript:showRefLink('http://leptoquark.hep.nd.edu/~ogre/',700,600)">OGRE</a>. Note the kinds data and plots you can generate. (It is best to start in OGRE's beginner mode.)  Find out the kind of answers you can get to what kinds of questions.
<p>
Formulate and answer a simple question of your own.  Find a line of questioning to push deeper, beyond the first plot, employing cuts in the data and multiple plots of the same data from different perspectives.  Then formulate a research question you believe you can explore with OGRE. </p>

<p>Save one or more OGRE plots in your logbook. Interpret the plot(s), mentioning the value, units and meaning of interesting features (such as the average value and distribution width in a histogram, or cluster of points in a scatter plot.) Now write your research question.</p>
