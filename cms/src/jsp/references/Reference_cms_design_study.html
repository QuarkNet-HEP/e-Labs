<b>Milestone: Choose a study (or design your own!)</b>
<p>  <i>The LHC and CMS are designed for discovery science. Scientists must calibrate new instruments based on confirmed measurements and data before they announce new discoveries. Follow along as CMS matures.</i>
<p>
Now that you've grasped the big picture and some fundamental physics behind the CMS experiment, you can work alongside physicists. Begin asking some questions of your own.<p>

Put it altogether. Sketch your study in your logbook.</p>

<P>When you are finished, check to see if you should attend a milestone seminar.</P>

<p>You can begin the study by going straight to the analysis tool.
