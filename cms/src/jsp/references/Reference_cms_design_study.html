<b>Milestone: Choose a study (or design your own!)</b>
<p>  <i>The LHC and CMS are designed for discovery science. Scientists must calibrate new instruments based on confirmed measurements and data before they announce new discoveries. Follow along as CMS matures.</i>

<p>Now that you've grasped the big picture and some fundamental physics behind the CMS experiment, you can work alongside physicists. Begin asking some questions of your own.
