<b>Milestone: Choose a study (or design your own!)</b>
<p>  <i>The LHC and CMS are designed for discovery science. Scientists must calibrate new instruments based on confirmed measurements and data before they announce new discoveries. Follow along as CMS matures.</i>
<p>
Now that you've grasped the big picture and some fundamental physics behind the CMS experiment, you can work alongside physicists. Begin asking some questions of your own.<p>

<P>When you are finished, check to see if you should attend a milestone seminar.</P>

<p>You can begin your study by going straight to the analysis tool. 

<p>Click on "Calibration" under "Data" in the navigation bar to analyze simulated data. Next click on "Exploration" to analyze experimental data.<br><img src="../graphics/calibration-menu.jpg"><p>
