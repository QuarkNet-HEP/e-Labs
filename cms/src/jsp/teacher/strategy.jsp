<p>
	The very nature of the CMS eLab is quite different 
	from traditional labs that can be completed in a lab period or a 
	couple of lab periods. CMS e-Lab experiments typically require 
	a great deal of  computer time to analyze data. Extra class time, 
	however, is not something most teachers have in an already full 
	course. You may also wonder how to provide each student time to 
	do an experiment when you have only a few computers.
</p>
<p>
	These are realistic questions. Here are approaches other 
	teachers have used. You may get some good ideas about how to 
	incorporate these experiments into your course but also to help 
	your students discover how particle physics experiments are 
	really done.
</p>
<h2>Individual or Small Group Long-term Integrated Project</h2>
<p>
	Organize the CMS experiments as a long-term project that spans a 
	quarter or even more. If students work on this project 
	intermittently, you can run these CMS experiments in 
	parallel with your "standard" curriculum with days set aside 
	periodically for CMS eLab work.
</p>
<p>
	After an introduction to  particles, the detector and the 
	<a href="javascript:research_questions()">research questions that 
	physicists ask in this field</a>, have 
	student groups write up a proposal for the study they 
	wish to perform. These studies might include shower depth, lateral size, 
	beam purity or detector resolution. with regard to  
	energy of the beam(50GeV) electrons or with regard to a particular 
	particle (pions)
</p>
<p>
	Groups can analyze their data and visit the 
	"Poster" section of the CMS eLab to research 
	the results of other student groups. Having your students 
	post their work here and/or having them give oral presentations 
	(sometimes with guest physicists!) may make for a great summary 
	to the project.

	for more details.
</p>

<h2>Collaborative Group Project</h2>
<p>
	Organize the CMS experiments as a short-term class collaborative 
	project that spans a few class periods. If students work on this project 
	collaboratively, you can run these CMS experiments in a few days as part 
	of your "standard" curriculum with days set aside 
	for CMS eLab work. Each of these studies are lengthy. Working in groups 
	may reduce the time needed to complete a study.
</p>
<p>
	After an introduction to  particles, the detector and the 
	<a href="javascript:research_questions()">research questions that 
	physicists ask in this field</a>, have 
	student groups write up a proposal for the study they 
	wish to perform. These studies might include shower depth, lateral 
	size, beam purity or detector resolution. with regard to  
	energy of the beam(50GeV) electrons or with regard to a particular 
	particle (pions).
</p>
<p>
	Divide the study into smaller tasks. 
	Below are some divisions which can be made:
	<table width="543" border="0">
		<tr>
			<th width="61" scope="col">Types of particles</th>
			<th width="162" scope="col">a) Electrons</th>
			<th width="115" scope="col">b)Pions</th>
			<th width="115" scope="col">c) Muons</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">i</th>
			<td> Energy 1 (ex.. 50 GeV)</td>
			<td>Energy 1 </td>
			<td>Energy 1 </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">ii</th>
			<td>Energy 2 (ex.150 GeV) </td>
			<td>Energy 2 </td>
			<td>Energy 2 </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">iii</th>
			<td>Energy3 ( ex.300 GeV) </td>
			<td>Energy 3 </td>
			<td>Energy 3 </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th scope="row">etc.</th>
			<td colspan="3">
				May continue until all available energies have
				been used (see data)
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</p>
<p>
	You may wish to assign each group a single particle (e.g. 
	electron, pion or muon).  For even smaller task you may wish to 
	assign each group a single particle at a single energy 
	(electrons at 5o GeV). after their groups have finished their 
	task they can prepare a report(written or oral ) for their 
	colleagues, the remainder of the class. White board or poster 
	presentations for each group are often effective here.
