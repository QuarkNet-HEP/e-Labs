				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				<p>
					Students can join a scientific collaboration in this series of studies of high-energy collisions from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. We are collaborating with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment to produce a student-led, teacher-guided project. At the present we have both test beam and Monte Carlo (simulated) data for analysis. When the LHC comes fully online, run data will become available as well. By using the web and GRID computing technology students are able to analyze these data types, and a virtual data portal enables students to share this data and associated analysis code with fellow students and other researchers.


</p><p>
Students use a data base and analysis tool on the website. The Online Graphical ROOT Environment (OGRE) is the analysis tool used to analyze the data they have chosen for their study. Tutorials are available to build basic scientific skills, to explain the how the detector works, to increase students' understanding of subatomic particles, to direct them in using the analysis tools and to explain how to use plots to analyze data. Students post the results of their studies as online posters, and then review the results of other studies online, comparing data and analyses. Using online tools, they can correspond with other research groups, post comments and questions, prepare summary reports and in general, participate in an aspect of scientific research that is often left out of classroom experiments.				</p>

				<h2>Introduction to Research:</h2>
				<p>
				The CMS Project explores the potential of using virtual data grid tools and techniques for secondary science education. Like the Cosmic ray e-Lab, this e-Lab provides an opportunity for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Students to do authentic research using exploratory virtual data tools to access, process and publish data, report and share their results as online posters, and have online discussions with one another about their work.</li>
					<li>Student researchers to experience membership in a scientific collaboration.</li>
					<li>Student researchers to make contributions to the study of particle physics.</li>
				</ul>
					<p>Situated in the LHC, the CMS detector will be used to study proton-proton collisions, in search of the predicted Higgs boson that may be instrumental in explaining why particles have mass. Pions, muons, electrons, photons, neutrinos and other particles are produced in these collisions and subsequent decays. By exploring the various subdetectors arrayed to detect this myriad of collision products and by attending to the crucial roles played by conservation of mass, momentum and charge in event analysis, students are able to make sense of the same plots which particle physicists use in analyzing collision data. They can in turn produce their own plots and use these to set up and pursue questions they themselves put to the data.</p>
					
				<h2>Prior Knowledge and Skills:</h2>
				<p>
					Before doing this project, students should know how to: 
					<ul>
						<li>Make simple measurements.</li>
						<li>Make simple calculations.</li>
						<li>Interpret simple graphs.</li>
						<li>Write a research question.</li>
						<li>Make a research plan.</li>
					</ul>

					We provide refresher references for students who need to brush up on 
					these skills. Students access these from "The Basics" section of the <a href="../home/index.jsp" target="show">Project Milestones</a>. 
				</p>
				
				<h2>Learner Outcomes and Assessment:</h2>
				<p>
					Students will know and be able to:  
					<ul>
						<li>Content and Investigation:
							<ul>
								<li>Describe particles colliding in and emerging from collisions detected by CMS as predicted by the Standard Model.</li>
								<li>List in order and describe the CMS subdetectors in terms of the properties of the particles they detect.</li>
								<li>Explain the role that conservation of mass/energy, momentum, and charge play in analyzing events detected at CMS.</li>
								<li>Design, conduct and report on an investigation of a testable hypothesis for which evidence can be provided using CMS data.</li> 								
							</ul>
						</li>
							<%@ include file="learner-outcomes.jsp" %>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Assessment is aligned to learner outcomes. While many teachers will want to design their own assessments, 
					we provide some options. 
					
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<B>Rubrics:</B> <A HREF="../assessment/rubric-ci.html">Content & Investigation</A>,
						<A HREF="../assessment/rubric-r.html">Process</A>, <A HREF="../assessment/rubric-t.html">Computing</A>,
						<A HREF="../assessment/rubric-wla.html">Literacy</A> and <A HREF="../assessment/rubric-p.html">Poster</A>
					</li>
					






	
						<li>
							<b>Tests</b>: <a href="../test/test.jsp?type=presurvey&studentid=0">Pre</a>
							- and <a href="../test/test.jsp?type=postsurvey&studentid=0">post</a>
							- tests of content knowledge and student results for 
							<a href="../test/results.jsp?type=presurvey">pre</a>
							- and <a href="../test/results.jsp?type=postsurvey">post</a>- tests.
						</li>
						
					

				
							<li>
							<b>e-Logbooks:</b> Track progress and provide feedback on student work.<br>
							Review student evidence of what they know/understand and reflections on their research.<br> 
							Review all student entries for a particular milestone&mdash;e.g., describe CMS physics&mdash;and make notes in your teacher's logbook for next year. 
							Look at this <a href="#" onclick="javascript:window.open('../graphics/logbook-sample.gif', 'content', 'width=504,height=373, resizable=1, scrollbars=1');return false;">sample logbook</a>.
							
							</li>
							<li>
							<b>Milestone Seminars:</b> Check student understanding before they move from one section of the project milestones to another. 
							</li>
					
				</ul>
			

				<h2>Research Question:</h2>
				<p>
					What kinds of particles are produced in the 
					proton-proton collisions inside the CMS detector? What are the 
					smallest known particles? Is there a Higgs boson? What causes 
					objects to have mass? Students can pose a number of questions 
					and then analyze the data for answers. Some answers are new to 
					students but well answered by physicists. These include the 
					smallest known particles, the kinds of particles that are 
					produced in proton-proton collisions and how these produced 
					particles interact with the detector. However, the cause of mass 
					is an open question that the CMS Collaboration hopes to address. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Students may be able to contribute insights to these efforts. 
					Many experiments have been investigating the smallest particles. 
					For example, the top quark was discovered at the accelerator at 
					Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory by the CDF and D0 collaborations. Students will be able 
					to see the results of other researchers in this field. 
					
					Students can explore simulated data, and once the LHC comes on line they can enter into the CMS research effort by analyzing run data, comparing it to simulated data, and sharing it with a collaboration of their peers.
