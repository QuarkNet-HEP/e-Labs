The CMS Test Beam e-Lab provides an 
                  opportunity for students to:
                  <UL>
                    <LI>Do authentic research to access, process and publish data, 
                      report and share their results as online posters, and have online 
                      discussions with one another about their work.
                    <LI>Experience the environment of scientific collaborations.
                    <LI>Possibly to make real contributions to a burgeoning scientific 
                      field. </LI>
                  </UL>
                  The project explores the potential of using the 
                  Internet and a new type of distributed computing called the Grid in 
                  high school science classes. </FONT>
                  <P>The CMS <font face="ARIAL"> detectors will upload data to a "virtual data 
                    grid" portal where ALL the data resides in various places on the Grid. This approach allows 
                    students to analyze a much larger body of data and to share analysis 
                    code. Also, it allows any school  
                    to participate in research by analyzing shared data since no school has an accelerator.  Only the Large Hadron Collider will have particles colliding at such high energies. </font> 
                  <FONT face=ARIAL>
                  <P>The website provides a place for students to:
                  <UL>
                    <LI>Organize their research.
                    
                    <LI>Write a poster to summarize their research.
                    <LI>Communicate with other school groups doing similar research. </LI>
                  </UL>
                  </FONT>
                  <P><font face="ARIAL">Currently, the project is designed for  students whose interest is in particle physics,  and would like to understand more about how the LHC gets ready to make actual runs.   We are just beginning to  test this site so we would appreciate any constructive criticism.      You may send email to lrose1@nd.edu. </font> <FONT face=ARIAL>&nbsp;</FONT>
                  <P>W<font face="ARIAL">e plan to build professional development into the 
                    teacher pages so that any physic or chemistry teachers can join the 
                    collaboration. </font> 
                  <FONT face=ARIAL>
                  <P>We also plan two levels of data analysis: the science-based 
                    interface and a more advanced interface for students interested in 
                    learning about and working with the Grid environment. <B>STAY
