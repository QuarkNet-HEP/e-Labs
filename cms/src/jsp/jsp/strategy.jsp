<P>
The very nature of cosmic ray experiments is quite different from traditional labs that can be completed in a lab period or a couple of lab periods. Cosmic ray experiments typically require a great deal of run time to collect data. Extra class time, however, is not something most teachers have in an already full course. You may also wonder how to provide each student time to do an experi-ment when you have only one setup.
<P> 
These are realistic questions. Here are approaches other teachers have used. You may get some good ideas about how to incorporate these experiments into your course but also to help your students discover how high-energy physics experiments are really done.

<B>A TITLE HERE, MAYBE - Intermittent Project</B><BR>
Organize the cosmic ray experiments as a long-term project that spans a quarter or even more. If students work on this project intermittently, you can run these cosmic ray experiments in parallel with your "standard" curriculum with days set aside periodically for cosmic ray detector work.
<P>
After an introduction to cosmic rays, the equipment, and the research questions that physicists ask in this field, have student groups write up a proposal for the experiment that they want to perform. These experiments might include calibration and performance studies, muon lifetime experiments, shower studies, or flux studies as a function of one of many variables, e.g., time of day, solar activity, angle from vertical, barometric pressure, etc. Your students can also look for particles that are strongly correlated in time and may be part of a wide-area shower.
<P>
Groups can analyze their data (or other data), visit the "Poster" section of the QuarkNet cosmic ray website to research the results of other student groups, etc. Having your students post their work here and/or having them give oral presentations (sometimes with guest physicists!) may make for a great summary to the project.
