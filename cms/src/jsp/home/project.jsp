                    Particle physics aims to answer two questions: What are the elementary constituents of matter?
                    What are the fundament forces that control their behavior at the most basic level? CERN's Large
                    Hadron Collider (LHC) and its experiments will probe deeper into matter than ever before.
                    The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is designed to detect fundamental particles:
                    electrons, muons, tau leptons, photons, and quark jets and missing energy due to very
                    weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos. Massive particles such as the Higgs boson
                    will decay into these fundamental objects, the properties of which will be measured in
                    the CMS detector's many subsystems.</p>
				<p>
                    The CMS e-Lab provides students with an opportunity to analyze data to calibrate the detector
                    and participate in discovery science (as particle physicists do). Calibrating the detector to
                    "rediscover" previous measured results is an important part of the early scientific activity at
                    CMS. Later students will probe data where physicists expect to find answers to questions at
                    the heart of 21st century particle physics.</p>

                    Join our learning community. Go to the teacher pages to find learner objectives and assessment
                    tools, standards, classroom notes and more. Your students begin the e-Lab at the Student Home
                    and cannot access this page or teacher pages from the student pages.</p>
