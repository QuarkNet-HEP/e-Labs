<strong>Feynman Diagrams</strong>

<p>Physicists represent the interaction of particles with Feynman diagrams; here's one for the interaction of up with antiup to produce a Z0 boson, 
which decays after a very short lifetime into a net neutral combination of muons, mu+, mu-: Other collision types produce net-zero-charged collision products, 
such as gluon to gluon which produces short-lived quark-antiquark pair, which may interact to produce a photon, decaying in turn into a pair of muons. 
Thus pairs of muons can have different parentage. Below are Feynman diagrams depicting gluon - gluon interactions resulting in dimuon decay products, 
the J-Psi and Upsilon particles.

<p>Feynman diagrams can be combined to generate a map of primary collision to detected decay products: this one represents one of the sought-after Higgs signatures!</p><br />
