Think of the difference between these data as roughly what we would expect to observe (created by computers) vs. what  we actually observe in nature.  In the plot below, the shaded area represents simulated (Monte Carlo) data, and the dark points what the CMS detector actually measured in 2010. </p>  <img src="../graphics/MCvRun2010.png"><br>    <hr>  <p><b><i>Going further</i></b></p> <p> The following discussion helps you understand how physicists use these data.</p><p><b>Experimental data</b> (sometimes called "run data") are obtained by observing the products of LHC collisions in the CMS detector. The idea behind a modern general-purpose detector such as CMS is to completely surround collisions and detect (as nearly as affordable) every resulting collision product.</p><p><b>Simulated events</b> are created with a computer using the Monte Carlo method. Particles in these events have properties predicted by theory, including some properties (energy, velocity) assigned at random to the extent that nature assigns such properties randomly. Since nature is complicated, so is the generation of simulated data: every theoretical assumption must be added, in an appropriate order. Theoretical assumptions made in the calculations are also informed by results from previous experiments, sometimes even from CMS results. This is computationally intensive, especially because the search for rare events requires lots of data to observe the expected statistical patterns. </p><p><b> Simulated vs. Experimental Data:</b> Simulated data sets range from a few events with particular assumptions to large sets with many assumptions. Experimental data is everything nature gives us. The larger the volume of experimental data, the larger the number of physics processes that have contributed to it, from the most common to the most rare. When they analyze experimental data, physicists carefully select data based on the kinds of physics processes they are studying. ("Applying cuts" and "filtering" data refer to data selection.) Studies that sit on the frontiers of "new physics" involve processes that occur in nature least frequently and require the most data and the longest time to study.</p><p>Simulated data show physicists what to look for when searching for predicted results. It is possible that theory is not fully able to predict, because there is new physics not yet well understood. Thus, differences between simulated and experimental data are of particular interest in the discovery of new physics. Physicists must be careful to make sure that the simulation properly takes into account all relevant known theory and all known details about the detector, so that a difference between simulated and experimental data might signal new physics rather than an incomplete matching of theory with experiment.</p><b>Resources:</b><ul><li><a href="http://www.fe.infn.it/u/bozzi/iub.ppt">Monte Carlo Simulation in High Energy Physics</a></li></ul></TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right"><HR><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</A></td></tr></table>        </BODY></HTML>
