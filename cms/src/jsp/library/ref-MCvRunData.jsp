You can think of the difference between these data types as roughly what we would expect to observe, vs. what you actually observe in experimental practice.   In the plot below, the shade area represents Monte Carlo data, and the dark points, what the CMS detector actually measured in 2010.</p>  <img src="../graphics/MCvRun2010.png"><br>  </TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right"><HR><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</A></td></tr></table>        </BODY></HTML>
