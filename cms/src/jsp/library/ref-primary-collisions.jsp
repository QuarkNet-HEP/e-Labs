To get a basic grasp on the kinds of interactions studied by CMS, recall that the LHC is a proton-proton collider and that 
protons are made up of other particles: u,u,d quarks, and gluons.<br />
Protons "collide" when some part of the proton collides with some part of the other proton. (Multiple part-to-part collisions for 
the same proton-to-proton interaction are too unlikely to require consideration.) There are as many kinds of primary collisions as there 
are pair combinations of these elements. The relative probabilities of any particular kind of part-to-part collision depends upon how many 
parts in each proton are of that same kind. Thus, up quark-to-up quark interactions are four times as probable as down-to-down. 
Can you see why? Can you estimate the relative probability for gluon-to-gluon interactions?<br />

In the high-energy collisions at LHC, matters are a bit more complicated still; gluons can fluctuate in and out of quark states, 
including quarks other than the u and d (the major quark components of the proton), such as charm <br />

Any of these components from one proton can collide with any other component of an oncoming proton, so that charm-down and up-antiup 
collisions (to take just two examples) occur with some probability in high-energy proton-proton collisions. Plainly there are a large number 
of collision types in the LHC, the proportion of each determined by the number of combinations of parts that will produce an interaction of that kind.<br /><br />
Those interactions that involve particles of zero net charge (either because both parts are neutral: the gluon to gluon interactions; or opposite in charge: the 
quark-antiquark interactions) can yield collision products that are themselves neutral in charge. The Z0 boson is a neutral product of this sort.
