   		    		    <p>Here's the dimuon mass spectrum from preliminary CMS run data. Think of this histogram as pairs of muons ordered in stacks according to a property called invariant mass, which is roughly just the sum of the kinetic energy of both muons in each pair.</p>
 
<p><img src="../graphics/mass-spectrum.gif"></p>
<p>Notice that this histogram has an overall shape, with notable peaks identified with symbols representing particles (&#961;, &#969;, &#968;, Z, etc.).  Each of these notable peaks (and the underlying shape, too) is due to a different physical process. Each of these physical processes can in principle produce pairs of muons of many different invariant masses, though each tends to produce more pairs around a given average value.  Under the J/Psi peak, for example, are many events produced by J/Psi decay but many others produced by quarks decaying to two muons.  Dimuon events of any given invariant mass can be produced by a number of different physical processes, but at a given mass they are more likely to come from some processes than others.</p>

<p>Now consider the hand-drawn conceptual representation of the dimuon mass spectrum, below.</p>
 <p><img src="../graphics/mass-spectrum-feynman.gif" border="1"></p>

<p>On it, Feynman diagrams for some of the most prominent physical processes are drawn and color-coded to features of that spectrum.  Consider just the section outlined in the yellow box, and notice the two black lines drawn above 91 GeV.  One of these represents a number of events with 91 GeV dimuon mass that would be expected just from the Drell-Yan physical process, and the other (higher line), the total number of such events from both the Drell-Yan and the Z decay processes.  Notice that most of the 91 GeV events are due to the Drell-Yan peak, which distributes all across the spectrum but in a way decreasing with mass. So (according to this drawing, which is not quantitatively accurate) whenever we look at a 91 GeV single event candidate, we are probably looking at an event produced by the Drell-Yan process.  But if we look at enough of such events, we'll see a concentration of them that is higher at 91 GeV than we would have expected from Drell-Yan processes alone.  That higher concentration is a pattern in the histogram that we explain by reference to the decay of the Z boson.  It is this kind of statistical pattern that we explain by reference to physical processes like the Z decay.  We cannot explain the causes of the individual events themselves.
