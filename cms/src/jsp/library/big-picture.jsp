							<p>This is the dawn of an exciting age of new discovery in the study of elementary particles
							and their interactions. The current theoretical framework of the fundamental nature of matter,
							known as the Standard Model, explains much, but leaves many unanswered questions. 
							What is dark matter? What happened to antimatter? Are there extra dimensions of spacetime?
							Are there new symmetries of nature? Are there new, as yet unobserved, forces? What is responsible for mass?
							<b>The Large Hadron Collider</b> (LHC), a huge scientific instrument at CERN, will provide the highest-energy
							particle collisions produced in a laboratory to the <b>Compact Muon Solenoid</b> (CMS) experiment that holds
							the potential to answer these questions:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Are there undiscovered principles of nature?</li>
								<li>How can we solve the mystery of dark energy?</li>
								<li>Are there extra dimensions of space?</li>
								<li>What is dark matter?</li>
								<li>How did the universe come to be?</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Learn how a 12,000 ton detector "sees" electrons, muons and other particles to discover
							new science. Begin by working along as CMS physicists calibrate the detector, "rediscovering"
							previously measured results such as known particle masses.
							These calibration studies are an important part of early scientific activity at CMS. Later
							you will be able to analyze CMS data that may lead to answers to questions at the heart of
							21st century particle physics.
						</p>
						<p>With CMS data, analysis tools and other features collectively known as the <b>CMS e-Lab</b>,
						you can generate and interpret your own plots from CMS data and share your insights in a published
						poster. Using the analysis tools requires some guidance. Just follow the Project Map through some
						basics of particle physics. Join the exploration of uncharted territory at the energy frontier
						and party like a particle physicist! Watch the <a href="../home/cool-science.jsp">Cool Science</a> video if you haven't yet.
