1 - You already extracted all the files from EQUIP.zip

2 - Use this folder or move somewhere else in your computer. You need to check that all these files have been extracted:

	EQUIP.jar
	freehep-jminuit-1.0.jar
	jcommon-1.0.17.jar
	jfreechart-1.0.14.jar
	junit.jar
	librxtxSerial.jnilib (only needed for Windows)
	RXTXcomm.jar
	rxtxSerial.dll (only needed for Windows)
	You might need to download the 32 bit version (depending on your machine)
	http://jlog.org/rxtx-win.html
	
	README
	
3 - Install driver from Silabs. A restart might be needed and connect the detector.
	(Download from: http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx)
	
4 - If you are using a MAC:
	Open a terminal window
	Type 'cd /var'
	Type 'sudo mkdir lock' (This will ask you for sudo password)
	Type 'chown -R [user]:wheel /var/lock' (where [user] is your username)

5 - To test if the install is successful (either a MAC or PC): 
	Open a terminal window (MAC) or cmd window (PC)
	type 'cd /path/to/folder/EQUIP'
	type 'java -jar EQUIP.jar'
	
	If everything is OK you will see output (in the terminal or cmd window) like the following and a java application called CosmicRayDetector will open up:
	*******************************************
	Experimental:  JNI_OnLoad called.
	Stable Library
	=========================================
	Native lib Version = RXTX-2.1-7
	Java lib Version   = RXTX-2.1-7
    *******************************************
    
    If you get any other output, please copy/paste it in an email to help@i2u2.org.
     

6 - You need at least Java 6 in your machine for this to work.
	To test, open a terminal window (MAC) or a cmd window (PC) and: 
	type 'java -version'
	You should expect some output like:
   	*******************************************
	java version "1.6.0_65" --> the first 6 indicates the version.
	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_65-b14-462-11M4609)
	Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.65-b04-462, mixed mode)
	*******************************************

	If Java is not installed, then you need to download it from: 
	https://www.java.com/en/download/
	And install it in your machine. You might need admin rights to do this.
