<I>All research centers on a single, well designed research question which scientists develop  by bridging from things they know into new territory.  They ask questions balanced between  simple and complex. <UL>   <LI>Too simple: it's already known and not interesting. <LI>Too complex: the question is intractable and unmanageable. </UL> <P>Research questions are also quided by the what is possible to measure. </I>  <P>Let's find a good research question.  Let's understand the experimental parameters.  <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('ref-cr-study.jsp')">Cosmic Ray Studies</A> - refine your search about cosmic rays <P> <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('studies.jsp')">Studies with Classroom Detector</A> - what can the cosmic ray collaboration tools measure? <P>  <B><A HREF="javascript:openPopup('logbook.jsp')">Log it</A>!</B> <P> <B>References</B>   <P STYLE="margin-left: 10px"><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~pavone/particle-www/ParticleExperiments/index.htm')">PARTICLE at the University of Rochester</a> - experiments<br> <P STYLE="margin-left: 10px"><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_cr.html')">COSMICOPIA</a> - Ask Us<br>
