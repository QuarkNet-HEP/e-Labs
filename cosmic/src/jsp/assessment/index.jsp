			<h1>Objectives: Assessing Your Work</h1>
				  <div id="objectives">
			
			<p>
			The following objectives outline what you will learn and be able to do during this study of cosmic rays.
			For assessment follow the guidance your teacher gave you at the beginning of the project.
			</p>
				   <ul>
					<li>Content:
						<ul>
							<li>Identify components of primary, secondary and later generation cosmic rays.</li>
							<li>Provide a complete list of properties of cosmic rays revealed in the observations.</li>
							<li>Explain the roles of the detector, the Internet, the Web and the Grid as scientific tools for this project.</li>
						</ul>
										
					<li>Process:
						 <ul>
							<li>Explain the data collection process including what corrections need to be made in order to obtain reliable data.</li>
							<li>Evaluate the data to decide which are reliable/usable and which are not and explain how you arrived at the decision to include some data and exclude others.</li>
							<li>Collect, organize and analyze data to obtain meaningful findings.</li>
							<li>Use the data to provide evidence to support your claims.</li>
							<li>Describe the contribution team members make in a several-person project.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Technology/Grid:
						<ul>
							<li>Demonstrate technical skill in accessing data from the Grid and Grid computing techniques. </li>
						</ul>
					<li>Literacy:
						<ul>
							<li>Demonstrate an ability to articulate meaning in writing (such as in science notebooks, reports) and negotiate meaning with others (such as peer review, discussion). </li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
