<p>Snippets from Paul and Ying's discussions on the quarknet mailing list</p>

<p><b>ThresholdTimes.pl</b></p>
<p>We are calculating (in ThresholdTimes) the time that an electrical signal in our detector was over some voltage threshold. When muons hit our detector, they deposit energy and this voltage rises beyond this certain threshold. If there were no threshold, we'd get all background noise.<br>
<br>
The rising edge and falling edge define the time to within 3/4's of a nanosecond as to when this signal rose above this threshold.<br>
<br>
Every Study bases its information on this absolute time of rising and falling edge. The "energy" of a particle can be inferred/guessed at from the time over threshold, but we aren't directly calculating any sort of "energy" of the particle.&nbsp;</p>

This is tough. You'll come across lines like this:<br>
B85CF2CD A8 37 00 01 00 01 00 01 3F341ABB 125828.858 010604 V 00 8 -1849<br>
BAB5E68B BE 01 00 01 00 01 00 01 3F341ABB 125829.858 010604 V 00 A -2850<br>
BAB5E68C 26 22 00 01 00 01 00 01 3F341ABB 125829.858 010604 V 00 8 -2850<br>
BB27258E B8 01 00 01 00 01 00 01 3F341ABB 125829.858 010604 V 00 A -2850<br>
BB27258F 01 2B 00 01 00 01 00 01 3F341ABB 125829.858 010604 V 00 8 -2850<br>
<br>
Now to unravel the events...<br>
A8 and 37 are a pair since A8 = 10101000<br>
BE and 22 are a pair since BE = 10111111<br>
Why isn't 26 and 22 a pair? First, this wouldn't make physical sense, but secondly, 26 = 00100110 does NOT have an 8th bit "1" so this signifies that this line is NOT the start of a new "board window". The hardware uses a predefined window ("board window") which it opens up a "gate" to look for events. Usualy this window is 240 nanoseconds. After that time, it has to close it's window and open up a new one.<br>
We reach the next line where we have B8 = 10111000 (8th bit is "1"). Meaning this is the start of a new board window which only happens on rising edges. This also means that rising edge "26" doesn't have a matching falling edge and is hence what I like to call an "orphan rising edge".<br>
2B matches B8 to complete the pair.<br>
<br>
This is way confusing for someone who just wants to see pairs of events...that's where the code comes in. It took lots and lots of testing to find all these quirks that can happen. I took several days to re-implement our original algorithm in the winter and it's pretty solid right now. There's still craziness that can happen with the GPS not updating, but it's pretty rare and we just haven't taken the time to write a checking algorithm for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ShowerStudy.pl</b></p>
<p>Shower study looks at these rising and falling edges in multiple files, and sorts them all by rising edge time. It then looks at a specific "window/gatewidth" of time to see how many RE-FE (rising edge falling edge) pairs are within that gatewidth. The gatewidth is usually something like 100 nanoseconds. If there is a true shower in one area you can imagine that multiple detectors (files) will have RE-FE pairs within that
gatewidth.</p>
<p><b>EventChoice.pl</b></p>
<p>EventChoice.pl takes an event number as an argument. It then uses that *single line* as the thing that Plot.pl will plot. We think that
by default, we may want to sort that file by number of events, and then choose event_num=1 for EventChoice.pl. Then the user would by default see the group with the most events. (but this is a *usage* of EventChoice.pl...the only coding difference would be the sorting.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>PerformanceStudy.pl</b></p>
<p>Performance Study simply creates a histogram of the "time of threshold" for the data. The time over threshold is simply the absolute rising edge time minus the absolute falling edge time. If all of the muons we detect have the same "energy" we expect them to be centered around some average time over threshold. Remeber, I said that time over threshold and energy don't have a direct mapping....but they are some function of each other. We expect the graph to be gaussian (bell curve).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>FluxStudy.pl</b><br>
<br>
Flux Study looks at how many events happened in a certain "window/gatewidth", and then divides by the area of the counter that detects the muons. In this study, the gatewidth is the only user defined variable since the areas of the panels are static.</p>
<p>It uses the Frequency.pm perl module to create bins to count how many particles were in the bins. It then divides by the area to get the flux for each bin.</p>
<p>>And how does &quot;$freq-&gt;frequency_distribution(\@bins)&quot; work?<br>
<br>
$freq is an instance of the Statistics::Descriptive::Full module which I use to find a frequency.<br>
frequency_distribution() takes a reference to the array of bins you wish to use. You could also<br>
have given it a scalar value, say 50, to say you want 50 bins. Beforehand, I setup the bins[]<br>
array to have values with the binWidth the user specifies. Julian day doesn't have anything to<br>
do with the frequency *calculation*...it's simply used to decide *when* to calculate the<br>
frequency. If we have data that spans 5 julian days, we will have 5 calls to the frequency<br>
module.</p>
<p>A different call to the frequency module happens for each day. So a different frequency is<br>
output for different julian days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>LifetimeStudy.pl</b><br>
<br>
Lifetime Study takes a bunch of datafiles and computes a poisson-like exponential curve. It gets its data from one event happening in a certain channel and then another event happening in that same channel within a certain gatewidth. This 2nd event must have less energy (time over threshold) than the 1st. This is because we're looking for muon decays that first give off an initial signal, stop in the counter, and then give off a smaller signal once they decay. The average lifetime is then just the average of all those event-smaller_event time differences. In the graph, the average can be computed using the exponent from the exponential function.
