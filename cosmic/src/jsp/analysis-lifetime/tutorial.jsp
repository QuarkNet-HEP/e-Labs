						A classic modern physics experiment is the measurement of the muon mean lifetime.  Some short-lived cosmic ray <a href="javascript:glossary('muon',100)">muons</a> that reach Earth's surface may stop in a <a href="javascript:glossary('counter',350)">counter</a>, 
						wait around a while and then <a href="javascript:glossary('decay',350)">decay</a>  into an electron, a neutrino and an anti-neutrino. The muon will leave one signature in the detector, and the electron will leave another. 
						You can ask, "How long before the muon decays?" "What is its <a href="javascript:glossary('lifetime',100)">lifetime</a>?"  Consider the figure below.
						<br>

						<br>
						When a muon enters a counter, a signal is generated in that counter. If the muon travels through counter 1 and into counter 2, both of these counters should 
						have a signal at approximately the same time.  This is called a two-fold <a href="javascript:glossary('coincidence',100)">coincidence</a> (signal seen in two counters within a certain small time window).  
						If the muon has stopped within counter 2, however, it will &quot;wait around&quot; until it decays and generate a second signal in the same counter (2) upon decay. 
						The time between the two signals in counter 2, t<sub>DECAY</sub>, can be calculated from the raw data file.  Furthermore, if no signal occurs in counter 3 (the veto counter), this is a strong 
						indication that a muon did indeed decay in counter 2.  Although existing  e-Lab tools donâ€™t include veto capability in software, the DAQ can be configured to require veto counters in hardware.  In other words,
						vetoes are a useful concept but not available in analysis at the moment.  

						See how the <A href="../flash/daq_only_standalone.html" target="_blank">detector works</a>.

					Muon
						decay follows an exponential 
						law&mdash;just like radioactive decay and many other natural phenomenon. 
						<a href="http://www.purplemath.com/modules/graphexp.htm">Exponential plots</a> have a characteristic shape.<p>
						
						Finding the value of the exponent leads to the 
						lifetime of the particle&mdash;one of many characteristics that allow us to describe 
						particles. Others include mass and electric charge.<p>
						<P>
						We measure the time between two <a href="javascript:glossary('signal',350)">signals</a>  in the same counter and look for patterns in the time difference between two consecutive signals. 
						The difference may result from a muon decay. Two types of backgrounds are minimized in the accompanying example.   Seeing many of these can increase your confidence in what you are observing.
						<br>
						1. Hardware errors on some signals with large pulse widths can generate fake second-hits at very small times, so times are excluded below 100ns.
						<br>
						2. The DAQ was configured so it did not collect times above 10 microseconds in a single triggered event.  Second hits in counter 2 could resulting from things other than an electron, 
						e.g. noise or a second muon, occur randomly and would occupy the regions at longer times.
