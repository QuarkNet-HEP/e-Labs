<center><h2>Good separation distance</h2></center>

<center>

We want to have a large enough separation so that the error on <br></br> 

<center>&Delta;t = time of arrival at counter 4 - time of arrival at counter 1</center><br></br>

is small compared to the time it takes a muon to traverse the distance between counters.  This argues for a very large distance.  
However, the rate of muons traversing both counters decreases as the counter separation increases due to loss of acceptance.
