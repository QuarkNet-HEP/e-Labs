<center><h2>Time of Flight Study:  Longer Paths</h2></center>

<center>
Regardless of direction, some muons travel a longer path than a muon that goes straight through counters 1, 2, & 4.  
This will skew our mean traversal time a bit higher than it should be.  If we take d to be the vertical distance between 
counters 1 and 4, speed will be systematically underestimated since v=d/t.
