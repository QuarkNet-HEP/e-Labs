<center><h2>Time of Flight Study:  Mean Error</h2></center>
As scientists, we need to understand how well we have measured the time.  In the above distribution, the red line represents 
a distance of one standard deviation from the mean (aqua line) in either direction.  In Run 2, we found &Delta;t = 6.31ns &plusmn; 2.82ns.  
If we measure another muon, it will fall within this range ~68% of the time.  That is interesting, but we want to estimate 
the error on the mean (average for all the muons).


<br>The standard error on the mean (SEM) is estimated by s/&radic;n. <br>
Therefore, we use this interval:<br>

<center>(x&#772; &plusmn; s/&radic;n) = 6.31ns &plusmn; 0.07ns,</center> 
where n is the number of entries (trials) in your histogram.
