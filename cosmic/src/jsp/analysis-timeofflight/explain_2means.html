<center><h2>Time of Flight Study:  2 means</h2></center>

<center>
Note:  There are fairly large errors (several ns) for the time of arrival of one muon, due to detector responses, 
compared to the time it takes a muon to traverse the distance between counters (1ns for each foot of separation).  
Therefore, we use the mean of the distribution of &Delta;t's to average over all the muons.  All muons have almost the same speed, 
so this is a good strategy.
