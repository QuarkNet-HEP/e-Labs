<center><h2>Time of Flight Study:  Muon Speed Error Estimate </h2></center>

The error on the muon speed is too complicated to describe correctly here, but let us approximate it.  <br></br>

Because it takes two data points to calculate the speed, we can assign &radic;2 * (percent error on the worst measured
data point) to be the error.  Run 3 has the fewest entries (thus, it is the worst measured).  

<br></br>The percent error is error/mean = 0.07/9.98 ~ 0.01.  
<br></br>Hence, &radic;2 * 0.01 ~ 1%.

<br></br>Since we found the speed to be 2.94 * 10^8 m/s, a 1% error is 0.03 * 10^8 m/s.
