Let's suppose your teacher ask you to move your desk outside (only the teacher knows why), and it began to rain.  As you sat forlorn and alone, you notice individual raindrops hitting your desktop just as the passing bell rang.  Knowing it is exactly 2 minutes until the next bell, you begin to count raindrops.  At the end of 2 minutes, you are proud of your concentration and accurately write down the number of raindrops which hit the desktop, suppose: 68 (it was a really slow rain).  Though you are moist, you are also determined to calculate the Rate of raindrops in one minute.  Which leads to the simple calculation:<P>Rate = #events / time<BR>Rate<sub>raindrops</sub> = 68 raindrops / 2 minutes<BR>Rate<sub>raindrops</sub> = 34 raindrops / minute<BR><P><B>Calculate Flux:</B><BR>Knowing a rate allows you to derived another more powerful quantity: flux.Flux equals the rate per area, or, another way, the amount (the count) of something (raindrops) per time (minute) per area (desktop).  So, extending what we know:<P>Flux<sub>raindrops</sub> = Rate<sub>raindrops</sub> / A<sub>desk</sub><BR>Flux<sub>raindrops</sub> = 34 raindrops/minute /  373000 mm<sup>2</sup><BR>Flux<sub>raindrops</sub> = 9.13 x 10<sup>-5</sup> raindrops/minute- mm<sup>2</sup><BR><P>The units we're using are not standard (metric), so let's convert.<P>Flux<sub>raindrops</sub> = 9.13 x 10<sup>-5</sup> raindrops/minute-mm<sup>2</sup> (1minute/60 s)(10<sup>6</sup> mm<sup>2</sup>/ 1 m<sup>2</sup>)<BR>Flux<sub>raindrops</sub> = 1.52 raindrops/s-m<sup>2</sup><BR><P>Flux plays an important role in cosmic ray studies, so you will see it again in your research.<P></TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right"><HR><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</A></td></tr></table>
