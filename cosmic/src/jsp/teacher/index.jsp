				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				<p>
					Students experience the environment of scientific collaborations 
					in this series of investigations into high-energy cosmic rays. 
					From start to finish this is a student-led, teacher-guided project. 
					Schools with cosmic ray detectors can upload data to the web. 
					A virtual data portal enables students to share this data and 
					associated analysis code with students at other schools whether 
					or not those schools have their own cosmic ray detectors. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To begin, students check the performance of the detectors they 
					have chosen for their study. They can then perform one of three 
					investigations: muon lifetime, muon flux or extended air showers. 
					Students post the results of their studies as online posters. 
					Then the real scientific collaboration begins. Students can 
					review the results of other studies online comparing data and 
					analyses. Using online tools, they can correspond with other 
					research groups, post comments and questions, prepare summary 
					reports, and in general participate in the part of scientific 
					research that is often left out of classroom experiments. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Students start this e-lab with an <A href="../home/splash.html">animation</A> that raises
					questions researchers ask about cosmic rays. <B>Bookmark it</B> as it is different
					than either Student Home below and you will want to direct your students there.

				<h2>Introduction to Research:</h2>
				<p>
					The QuarkNet/Grid Project explores the potential of using virtual 
					data grid tools and techniques for secondary science education. 
					The project begins with a pilot cosmic ray study that provides 
					an opportunity for:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Students to do authentic research using exploratory virtual 
						data tools to access, process and publish data, report and 
						share their results as online posters, and have online 
						discussions with one another about their work. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Student researchers to experience the environment of 
						scientific collaborations. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Student researchers to make real contributions to the study 
						of high-energy cosmic rays.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Cosmic rays are typically protons, neutrons, gamma rays or other 
					particles that originate in any number of astronomical objects. 
					When these "primary" cosmic rays encounter earth's atmosphere, they 
					can interact with nuclei of atoms and produce new, often unstable 
					particles (e.g., pions and kaons.) In turn, these secondary cosmic 
					rays further decay and create muons, electrons, photons and neutrinos. 
					If these cosmic rays are sufficiently energetic, they can reach the 
					earth's surface and be detected. (Neutrinos are capable of passing 
					through the earth and are generally undetected.) 
				</p>
				<p>
					Occasionally the primary possesses tremendous energy. These create 
					many, many decay products. An array of detectors on the earth's 
					surface can indirectly measure the energy of the primary by counting 
					the number of particles in the detector array simultaneously. These 
					observations can lead to a calculation of the part of the sky that 
					the primary came from.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Prior Knowledge and Skills</h2>
				<p>
					Before doing this project, students should know how to: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Make simple measurements.</li>
					<li>Make simple calculations.</li>
					<li>Interpret simple graphs.</li>
					<li>Write a research question.</li>
					<li>Make a research plan.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We provide refresher references for students who need to brush up on 
					these skills. Here is what the students see:

					<a href="../library/research-basics.jsp">Review of Basic Skills</a>
				</p>
					
				<h2>Learner Outcomes:</h2>
				<p>
					Students will know and be able to: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Content:
						<ul>
							<li>Identify components of primary, secondary and later generation cosmic rays.</li>
							<li>List properties of cosmic rays revealed in the observations.</li>
							<li>Describe the roles of the cosmic ray detector and the Internet.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
						
					<li>Process:
						<ul>
							<li>Gather/use scientific data to identify properties of cosmic rays.</li>
							<li>Demonstrate skills using Internet, web and virtual data techniques.</li>
							<li>Work collaboratively with students in other research groups.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Research Question:</h2>
				<p>
					How much area can a cosmic ray shower cover? Where do cosmic 
					rays come from? Students can pose a number of questions and 
					then analyze the data for answers. Some answers are new to 
					students but well answered by physicists. These include the 
					muon lifetime, rate of cosmic ray arrival as well as the 
					source of low-energy air showers. However, the origin of the 
					highest-energy cosmic rays is an open question-several 
					experiments are actually exploring it now. Students may be 
					able to contribute data to these efforts.

					Many experiments have measured cosmic array showers, including 
					CASA (Chicago Area Scintillator Array), project G.R.A.N.D. 
					(Gamma Ray Astrophysics at Notre Dame) and the Pierre Auger 
					Project (an array being set up in Argentina). 
				</p>
				<p>
					Students will be able to look into the size of cosmic ray 
					showers by comparing their cosmic ray detector data with that 
					from others across a wide area to see where particles struck 
					earth's surface in closely correlated time windows. Also, 
					students will be a part of this ongoing research by providing 
					data to a collaboration of their peers. These data contain 
					stamps for time and geographic location information.
