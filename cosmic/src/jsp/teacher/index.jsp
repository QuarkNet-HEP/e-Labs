						Working in a research group, students experience the environment of scientific collaborations 
						in this series of investigations into high-energy cosmic rays. 
						From start to finish this is a student-led, <b>teacher-guided</B> project. 
						Schools with cosmic ray detectors can upload data to the web. 
						A virtual data portal enables students to share these data and 
						associated analysis code with students at other schools whether 
						or not those schools have their own cosmic ray detectors. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Students begin their research by watching a Cool Science video to understand the context of they project. They check the performance of the detectors they 
						have chosen for their study. Then they can perform one of three 
						investigations: muon lifetime, muon flux or extended air showers. 
						Students can use the project milestones to conduct their research and
						can record their work and reflect on their progress in their e-Logbook. Students post the results of their studies as online posters. 
						The real scientific collaboration follows. Students can 
						review the results of other studies online comparing data and 
						analyses. Using online tools, they can correspond with other 
						research groups, post comments and questions, prepare summary 
						reports and, in general, participate in the part of scientific 
						research that is often left out of classroom experiments. 
					</p>
					<p> Two sample posters are available:</p>

				<p>
					Cosmic rays are typically protons, neutrons, gamma rays or other 
					particles that originate in any number of astronomical objects. 
					When these "primary" cosmic rays encounter earth's atmosphere, they 
					can interact with nuclei of atoms and produce new, often unstable 
					particles (e.g., pions and kaons). In turn, these secondary cosmic 
					rays further decay and create muons, electrons, photons and neutrinos. 
					If these cosmic rays are sufficiently energetic, they can reach the 
					earth's surface and be detected. (Neutrinos are capable of passing 
					through the earth and are generally undetected.) 
				</p>
				<p>
					Occasionally the primary cosmic ray possesses tremendous energy, creating
					many decay products. An array of detectors on the earth's 
					surface can indirectly measure the energy of the primary by counting 
					the number of particles in the detector array simultaneously. These 
					observations can lead to a calculation of the part of the sky that 
					the primary came from. Many experiments have measured cosmic array showers, including:

				<p>
					How much area can a cosmic ray shower cover? Where do cosmic 
					rays come from? Students can pose a number of questions and 
					then analyze the data for answers. Some answers are new to 
					students but well answered by physicists. These include the 
					muon lifetime, rate of cosmic ray arrival as well as the 
					source of low-energy air showers. However, the origin of the 
					highest-energy cosmic rays is an open question&mdash;scientists are trying
					to answer this question now. Students may be 
					able to contribute data to these efforts.
					Students will be able to look into the size of cosmic ray 
					showers by comparing their cosmic ray detector data with that 
					from others across a wide area to see where particles struck 
					earth's surface in closely correlated time windows. (Data contain time and geographic location information.)  
					Students will be a part of this ongoing research by providing 
					data to a collaboration of their peers.

						<a name="Cosmic_Ray_Detector"></a><h4>Detectors Students Use</h4>
						<p>The data for this e-Lab comes from detectors operated by high school students around the world. If you have a detector, you should become familiar with
							how to set it up and take data.</p>  
						<ul>
							<li>Read this <a href="detector.jsp">Introduction to the QuarkNet cosmic ray detector</a>.</li>
						</ul>
				
						<p>To obtain a detector, pending funding, contact:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="mailto:rspete@fnal.gov">Bob Peterson</a> if you area member of QuarkNet.</li>
							<li><a href="mailto:hoppert@fnal.gov">Dave Hoppert</a> if you are not a member of QuarkNet and want to purchase a detector.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Fermilab gathers the requests, place orders for the parts in early spring and fills the orders throughout the summer.</p>

						<a name="Experiments_Students_Can_Perform"></a><h4>Experiments Students Can Perform</h4>
						<p>
							<b>Calibrations and performance studies</b> - Before students can "trust" the cosmic ray equipment, they 
							should do some calibrations to study the response of the 
							counters and the board. Calibration studies include 
							plateauing the counters, threshold selection and barometer 
							calibration. In addition, the QuarkNet online analysis 
							tools include a "system performance" study for uploaded data.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Flux Experiments</b> - Students can do a variety of flux experiments 
							investigating such things as cosmic ray flux as a function of 
							time of day, solar activity, angle from vertical, barometric 
							pressure, altitude. The list goes on. This can be an exciting 
							set of experiments as students study the factors that they 
							want to test.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							<b>Muon Lifetime Experiments</b> - A classic modern physics experiment to verify time dilation 
							is the measurement of the muon mean lifetime. Since nearly all 
							of the cosmic ray muons are created in the upper part of the 
							atmosphere (&raquo; 30 km above the earth's surface), the time of 
							flight for these muons as they travel to earth should be at 
							least 100 microseconds: 
						</p>
						

     					<%--<p style="font-size: 150%">$$ t_{muon} = \frac{d}{v_{muon}} = \frac{30 \times 10^3 m}{3 \times 10^8 \frac{m}{s}} = 100 \mu s$$</p>--%>
						<p><img src="../graphics/muon-lifetime-formula.png" /></p>				

						<p>
							This calculation assumes that muons are traveling at the speed 
							of light - anything slower would require even more time. If a 
							student can determine the muon lifetime and show that it is 
							significantly less than this time, they are presented with the 
							wonderful dilemma that the muon's time of flight is longer than 
							its lifetime! 
						</p>
						<p>
							This time dilation "proof" assumes that all muons are created in 
							the upper atmosphere. Although this is actually a good 
							approximation, students cannot test it. However, by using 
							the mean lifetime value and by measuring flux rates at two 
							significantly different elevations, one can develop experimental 
							proof for time dilation. This experiment requires 
							access to a mountain, an airplane, or collaboration with a team 
							from another school that is at a significantly different altitude! 
							Here is a wonderful opportunity for schools to work together 
							proving time dilation. A very thorough explanation of this 
							experiment is outlined in the 1962 classroom movie titled, "Time 
							Dilation: An Experiment with Mu Mesons." (This 30 minute movie 
							can be ordered on CD for $10 from <a href="http://www.physics2000.com/">Physics2000</a>.)   This 
							movie helps students understand how to verify time dilation using the muon 
							lifetime measurement (along with flux measurements at two 
							different altitudes).
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Shower Studies</b> - With the GPS device connected to the DAQ board, the absolute 
							time stamp allows a network of detectors (at the same site or at 
							different schools) to study cosmic ray showers. Students 
							can look for small showers or collaborate with nearby schools to look for larger showers. 
					
							The QuarkNet online analysis tools allow students to not only 
							look for showers but to calculate the direction from which the 
							shower (and thus the primary cosmic ray) originated.
