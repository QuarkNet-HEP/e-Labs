<h1>Website features that guide and support student research.</h1>

<h2>Research Guidance for Students</h2>

	<a href="web-guide.jsp">Research Guidance</a> - 
	<a href="activities.jsp">Sample Classroom Activities</a>
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
	The first time students enter the website, an animation flashes sample research 
	questions. Students must go through several pages in order:
	<ol>
		<li>
			<strong>Pre-test</strong> if their teacher requested it when registering 
			them. Students will not be able to access the Welcome page until all 
			students in their research group have taken the pre-test.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Welcome:</strong> Who are we and what will students do. Sample 
			poster and paper show the end product of the research.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Tips for using the website.</strong>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Study Guide:</strong> Presents a series of research milestones. 
			Each milestone has a link <img src="../graphics/ref.gif"/> to resources 
			and an electronic logbook so students can save their work as they go.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
<p>
	The main navigation bar appears first on the Study Guide (#3 above) and on all 
	pages after that. <img src="../graphics/nav.jpg"/> 
</p>
<p>
	Most of the pages also have a sub menu to provide both an overview of what is 
	available and  easy access. <img src="../graphics/subnav.jpg"/>
</p>
<h2><a href="../home/milestones-map.jsp"><strong>Study Guide</strong></a> and alternate 
	<a href="../home/milestones.jsp"><strong>text version</strong></a></h2>
<p>
	The study guide is divided into four sections excluding the pre-test and post-test:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>The Basics:</strong> Reviews basic research skills.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Get Started:</strong> Prepares the team to design their 
			investigation with links to information about cosmic rays, the detector 
			and a research proposal.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Figure It Out:</strong> Prepares the team to ananlyze data with 
			links to how to take and upload data, use data search parameters, choose 
			analysis tools, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Tell Others:</strong> Prepared team to enter into scientific 
			discourse. Links to how to write up investigation, create a poster and 
			comment on the work of others.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2>Glossary and Resources</h2>
<p>
	The website has a glossary and resources for the milestones in the study guide 
	(represented by <img src="../graphics/ref.gif"/>). Entries show in popup windows 
	when a definition or resource is needed. The entire glossary and resource list 
	are available from the study guide page.
</p>
<h2>e-Logbook</h2>
<p>
	As students work through the study guide they have access to an optional online 
	logbook where they can save their notes. They can enter notes for each milestone 
	in the study guide and into general notes. Teachers are able to access this work, 
	track and assess student progress and give comments.
	Access is through link in upper right hand corner on every page. 
	<img src="../graphics/logbook_link.gif"/><br/>
	From their logbook, they can access:
	<ul>
		<li>
			by milestone for all their student research groups. 
			<img src="../graphics/logbook_milestone.gif"/>
		</li>
		<li>
			by student research group. <img src="../graphics/logbook_group.gif"/> 
		</li>
		<li>
			their own logbooks of entries about each research group. 
			<img src="../graphics/logbook_my.gif"/>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2><a href="../library/resources.jsp"><strong>Resources</strong></a></h2>
<p>
	On the Library submenu is a link to references that include:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Tutorials:</strong> Step-by step instructions and tutorials for each of the studies.</li>
		<li><strong>Contacts:</strong> Experts and student research groups.</li>
		<li><strong>Online:</strong> Other URLs of interest.</li>
		<li><strong>Animations:</strong> Aids to help students understand detector, 
		and how the collaboration relies on grid techniques.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2><a href="../posters/"><strong>Posters</strong></a></h2>
<p>
	Students may publish their work as a poster or a paper. We provide a webform for 
	them to enter text, select figures from the website, and coming soon uploaded 
	images of their own.
</p>
<p>
	Associated with posters are areas for comments. This allows students to comment 
	on the work of other students and ask questions.
