<p>
	The very nature of cosmic ray experiments is quite different from traditional 
	labs that can be completed in a lab period or a couple of lab periods. Cosmic 
	ray experiments typically require a great deal of run time to collect data. 
	Extra class time, however, is not something most teachers have in an already 
	full course. You may also wonder how to provide each student time to do an 
	experi-ment when you have only one setup.
</p>
<p>
	These are realistic questions. Here are approaches other teachers have used. 
	You may get some good ideas about how to incorporate these experiments into 
	your course but also to help your students discover how high-energy physics 
	experiments are really done.
</p>
<h2>A TITLE HERE, MAYBE - Intermittent Project</h2>
<p>
	Organize the cosmic ray experiments as a long-term project that spans a 
	quarter or even more. If students work on this project intermittently, you 
	can run these cosmic ray experiments in parallel with your "standard" 
	curriculum with days set aside periodically for cosmic ray detector work.
</p>
<p>
	After an introduction to cosmic rays, the equipment, and the research 
	questions that physicists ask in this field, have student groups write up a 
	proposal for the experiment that they want to perform. These experiments 
	might include calibration and performance studies, muon lifetime 
	experiments, shower studies, or flux studies as a function of one of many 
	variables, e.g., time of day, solar activity, angle from vertical, 
	barometric pressure, etc. Your students can also look for particles that 
	are strongly correlated in time and may be part of a wide-area shower.
</p>
<p>
	Groups can analyze their data (or other data), visit the "Poster" section 
	of the QuarkNet cosmic ray website to research the results of other student 
	groups, etc. Having your students post their work here and/or having them 
	give oral presentations (sometimes with guest physicists!) may make for a 
	great summary to the project.
