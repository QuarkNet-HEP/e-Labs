					The Cosmic Ray e-Lab provides an online environment in which students experience 
					the excitement of scientific collaboration in this series of investigations into 
					high-energy cosmic rays. Schools with cosmic ray detectors upload data to a 
					"virtual data" portal where ALL the data resides. This approach allows 
					students to analyze a much larger body of data and to share analysis code. Also, 
					it allows schools that do not have cosmic ray detectors to participate in research 
					by analyzing shared data.
				</p>
				

				<p>
					Students learn what cosmic rays are, where they come from and how they hit the Earth. 
					While scientists understand cosmic rays with low to moderate energies, some cosmic 
					rays have so much energy that scientists are not sure where they come from. A number 
					of research projects are looking at this question. Students will have a chance to 
					gain their own understanding of cosmic rays and may be fortunate enough to capture 
					a rare highly-energetic cosmic ray shower on their classroom detector and analyze 
					their results with this e-Lab.
