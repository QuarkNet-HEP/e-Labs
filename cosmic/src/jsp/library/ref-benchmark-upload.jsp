		<h2>Benchmark File</h2>
		<p>A <strong>Benchmark File</strong> represents a high quality one day data file for a single geometry and coincidence.</p>
		<p>Other data files will be compared to this file to <strong>bless</strong> the new upload.</p> 
		<p>When the detector is reconfigured with a new coincidence or geometry you have to designate a new benchmark (See "Add Benchmark").</p><br />
		<p><strong>How do you judge a "Benchmark File"?</strong><br />
			<ul>
				<li>Steady singles & trigger rates.</li>
				<li>Sufficient rates to assure adequate S/N.</li>
			</ul>
			Note: for the "6000" series QuarkNet counters, the singles rate is usually between 12 to 35 Hz.<br />
			Other style counters will be different and is best determined by plateauing counters (see CR e-Lab&#8594;LIBRARY&#8594;Resources&#8594;Tutorials for plateauing instructions).
