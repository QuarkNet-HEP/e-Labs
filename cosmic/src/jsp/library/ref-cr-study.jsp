That's okay.  To start, catalog what you do know and what you would like to know. You might want to work in a group with other students&mdash;six heads are better than two. <P>Make two lists of things that you,<UL><LI>Know: Facts about cosmic rays <LI>Need to Know: Other topics about cosmic rays you want to find out about.</UL>Make sure the "Know" list includes facts and not opinions. If you <i>think</i> you know (Not sure? Can't back it up?), put it under "Need to Know" that will probably be longer than the "Know." Again, that's okay! <P>The "Need to Know" list leads to the areas you should investigate. Quickly, ideas will cluster into overarching areas; these areas will suggest directions of research and areas to examine.  The list also suggests areas of expertise and different functional components.<P>Do you see thematic questions emerging from your lists?<UL>  <LI>What characteristics of cosmic rays? <LI>What stays the same  about cosmic rays?  <LI>What changes? <LI>What is the relation of cosmic rays to . . . ?  <LI>How would you classify cosmic rays . . . ?  <LI>What would happen if cosmic rays . . . ? <LI>How would I explain . . .  about cosmic rays?  <LI>Can I predict . . .  about cosmic rays?  <LI>What approach would I use to . . .  about cosmic rays?  <LI>How would I model . . .  about cosmic rays?<LI>How do cosmic rays affect . . . ?  </UL><P>As you progress from the basic toward building a specific research question, broaden your search into other disciplines such as chemistry, biology, and earth science.  Cosmic rays may affect many areas of life.  Can you think of others? <P>Finally, narrow your research topic into a concentrated area of one or two related questions.  Be willing to receive feedback from teammates, your teacher, and experts.  It may take several iterations as your research question evolves into a robust topic.</TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right"><HR><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</A></td></tr></table>    </body></html>
