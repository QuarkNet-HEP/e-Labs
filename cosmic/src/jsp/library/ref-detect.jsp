The scintillator is covered with reflective material (aluminum foil works) and then with black paper and tape to make it "light-tight." Completed counters are hooked up to the data acquisition board (DAQ), which feeds into the parallel port of a computer. When a cosmic ray muon passes through the scintillator, it causes a few photons to be emitted by impurities in the scintillator material. These are picked up by the PMTs, converted to an electrical pulse and amplified. Each PMT sends its signal to the DAQ. A GPS tracks the time and location of the pulses.<P> <B>Muon Counting Experiments</B><BR> When counting muons, the DAQ looks for "coincidences"&mdash;two signals (one from each of two PMTs) which are received within a very short time. These are reported to the computer; all other signals are vetoed as likely noise from the PMTs. The computer can count the number of muons that come in over an interval to get a rate count.<P> <B>Muon Lifetime Experiments</B><BR> Some muons will be of low energy and will lose that energy in the scintillator. Such a muon will remain there for a short time until it decays into an electron and two neutrinos. We cannot detect the neutrinos, but we can detect the electron as it causes a few more photons to be emitted by impurities in the scintillator material. The DAQ measures the time between the "muon signal" and the "electron signal." These double hits and their time intervals are reported to the computer. The data can be fed into a spreadsheet and analyzed to calculate the lifetime of the muon.</TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right" colspan=2><HR><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</A></td></tr></table>    </BODY></HTML>
