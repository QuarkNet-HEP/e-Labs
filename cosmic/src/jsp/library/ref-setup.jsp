Setting up the detector for your study is a non-trivial task with multiple considerations. Most of these are done once. An outline is below.	<ol>															<li>				<strong>					GPS Installation				</strong>				<br>				The detector relies upon timing signals from a GPS antenna. This may be outside or near a window. You may need a ladder and a clever way to get the antenna cable back to the detector. Good luck!			</li>					<li>				<strong>					Cabling				</strong>				<br>				The GPS cable is only one of several cables that require proper routing, placement and connection to the detector. Each of the four counters needs a power cable and a signal cable to function. The data acquisition card (DAQ) needs power and GPS input as well as signal input from each cable. Be sure to make and check all of your connections before plugging in any power.			</li>					<li>				<strong>					Calibration				</strong>				<br>						Scintillating counters require calibration. We often refer to this process as "plateauing." You must measure the rate of counts across a range of operating voltages and look for the voltage range in which the rate doesn't increase much. On a plot of rate vs. voltage, this region resembles a plateau.			</li>					<li>				<strong>					Your Experiment				</strong>				<br>				Consider what you are trying to measure. Set up the counters and  conincidence level accordingly. Write it all down in your logbook and record your data on the computer.			</li>					<li>				<strong>					Detector Geometry				</strong>				<br>				The e-Lab needs to know where the counters are with respect to the GPS antenna. We call this "geometry." Knowing the locations is important in many calculations that the e-Lab makes on your data files. Get a tape measure and determine the location of each of the four counters.			</li>					<li>				<strong>					Data Uploads				</strong>				<br>				Once you have run the experiment, upload the data to the e-Lab. You can make notes about the setup that you used when collecting data and will be prompted to record your geometry.			</li>		</ol>			</body></html>
