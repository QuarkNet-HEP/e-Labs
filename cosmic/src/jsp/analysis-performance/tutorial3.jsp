						This study aims to understand the quality of the collected data. One tool for this is a 
						histogram of the number of events with a particular length of Time over Threshold (ToT).<p>

						In a very loose sense, ToT is a measure of the amount of energy deposited in the 
						<a HREF="javascript:glossary('scintillator',350)">scintillator</a> for a given 
						<a HREF="javascript:glossary('muon',100)">muon </a>passage. There is a correlation 
						between the<a HREF="javascript:glossary('pulse_width',350)"> width of the pulse</a> 
						in time and the height of the pulse. A well calibrated 
						<a HREF="javascript:glossary('counter',350)"> counter</a> shows a good 
						Gaussian distribution of ToT.<p>

						This particular graph shows a very noisy counter with a large peak centered at 3 ns. 
						This peak is so large that the Gaussian that may be centered near 8 ns is obscured.
