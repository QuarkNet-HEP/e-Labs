Coordiated Universal Time - Time kept by atomic clocks located at time labs around the globe and delivered by the GPS satellites.
UTC is five hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time. UTC replaced GMT as the time reference.
Times given in UTC are almost always given in terms of a 24-hour clock. Thus, 14:42
(often written simply 1442) is 2:42 p.m., and 21:17 (2117) is 9:17 p.m.
