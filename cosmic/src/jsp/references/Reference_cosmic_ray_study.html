<b>Milestone: Determine what you can study about cosmic rays.</b><P> <I>All research centers on a single, well designed research question which scientists develop  by bridging from things they know into new territory.  They ask questions balanced between  simple and complex. <UL>   <LI>Too simple: it's already known and not interesting. <LI>Too complex: the question is intractable and unmanageable. </UL> <P>Research questions are also quided by the what is possible to measure. </I>    <P>Let's find a good research question.  Let's understand the experimental parameters.  <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../library/ref-cr-study.jsp',500,610)">Cosmic Ray Studies</A> - refine your search about cosmic rays <P>   <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../library/ref-studies.jsp',850,600)">Studies with Classroom Detector</A> - what can the cosmic ray collaboration tools measure?    <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../jsp/logEntry.jsp?keyword=cosmic_ray_study',700,600)"><b>Log it!</b><IMG SRC="graphics/logbook_pencil.gif" border="0"  align="middle"></A>  <P> <B>References</B>     <P STYLE="margin-left: 10px"><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~pavone/particle-www/ParticleExperiments/index.htm',1000,600)">PARTICLE at the University of Rochester</a> - experiments<br>   <P STYLE="margin-left: 10px"><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_cr.html',850,600)">COSMICOPIA</a> - Ask Us<br>
