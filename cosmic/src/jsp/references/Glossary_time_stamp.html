A time value attached to an event on the data acqusition board (DAQ).  The time derives its accuracy from the GPS
time signal picked up by the GPS module attached to the DAQ.  
The time precision is of the order of tens of nanoseconds, and this precision allows
the coordination of data during a cosmic ray shower.
