The Sun provides a constant flux of charged particles.  The level of these particles rise and
fall depending on the solar activity.  These events result from solar flares.
When the particles reach the Earth they cause aurora, geomagnetic storms, and disruption
of made-made infrastructure such as navigation systems and electrical power grids.
