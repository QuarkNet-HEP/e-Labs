DAQ: QuarkNet <b>D</b>ata <b>A</b>c<b>q</b>uisition Board - Electronic device that interprets the raw photomultiplier tube (PMT) signals and searches for patterns within them. If the signals match a user-specified pattern, the DAQ sends data to a local computer. The DAQ also interprets data from an attached GPS antenna (for timing the arrival of raw PMT signals), as well as sensors for temperature and barometric pressure.
