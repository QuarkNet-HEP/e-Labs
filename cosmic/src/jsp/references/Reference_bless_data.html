		<tr><td><strong>Data Plots</strong></td></tr>
		<tr><td>All plots share the same <strong>X-Axis</strong>: seconds since midnight UTC. A full, 24-h day has 86,400 
				seconds (24*60*60). Files start at midnight of one day (or when data started writing) and end at midnight the
				following day (or when data stopped writing).</td></tr>

		<tr><td><i>All channels here are remarkably stable over the entire data run</i></td></tr>
		<tr><td>Data come from a detector with four counters attached to four channels. Each counter fires independently. 
				We count independent firings, calculate and plot the rate (#counts/second, Hz). Each channel can be toggled
				on/off and Y axis scale max can be customized.</td></tr>

		<tr><td><i>Number of “triggers” over time, Trigger Rate, also known as Coincidence Rate</i></td></tr>
		<tr><td><i>This detector has a very low trigger rate; the counters must not be stacked atop each other.</i></td></tr>
		<tr><td>A trigger occurs when the counters fire in a prescribed combination. This detector was set to so-called 
				“two-fold” coincidence (CR0:1F). That means that the detector will only trigger when two or more counters 
				fire within a short time window. This plot shows the rate (#counts/second, Hz) at which that happens 
				throughout the day. The Y axis scale max can be customized.</td></tr>

		<tr><td>Four plots show one of four detector parameters over time
				Visible GPS Satellites—the detector relies on timing information from GPS satellites. 
				This plot shows the number in view. Voltage—the detector has a voltage regulator that might drift. 
				We track the voltage in order to understand detector response. The drift here is nominal.
				Barometric Pressure—the DAQ has a pressure sensor. When calibrated, it tells atmospheric pressure.
				Temperature—the GPS unit has a temperature probe.</td></tr>
