Primary cosmic rays can interact with nucleons in Earth's upper atmosphere.
Showers occur when these primaries are extremley energetic, and produce large numbers
of secondary particles (mostly pions and kaons).  The secondaries promptly decay into
the particles that strike Earth's surface. During a shower, thousands of these particles 
can strike an area as large as several square kilometers nearly simultaneously.
