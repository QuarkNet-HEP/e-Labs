  <b>Milestone: Know how to correct for background and errors when
  appropriate.</b>

  <p><i>Measuring cosmic rays is an indirect process; you cannot
  see or feel them. It is difficult to be sure that you are
  measuring what you intend. Other processes can mimic the signal
  and mix in with the data. You must separate real data from
  background noise.</i></p>

  <p><u>Measurement Errors</u><br />
  Each data file has a matching set of blessing plots. 
  These can be viewed by clicking on the "blessed star" next to the data file.<br />
  The blessing plots give clear indication of the "steadiness" of the singles and the trigger rates (trigger is also concidence rate).<br />
  The plateauing process will help you set optimal rates (see library: resources for plateauing tools and guidance).
  More importantly, the rates should not be changing over time which indicates data contamination from signal noise.<br />
  When a file becomes "blessed", it has been compared to a benchmark or standard file that reflects two qualities shown in the
  blessing plots: <br /><br />
  a - steadiness <br />
  b - reasonable rate levels determined during counter plateauing <br /><br />
  A "blessed" file is believed to be trustworthy by the owner as compared to the benchmark file.
