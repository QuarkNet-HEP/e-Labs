  <b>Milestone: Know how to collect data and upload files to our server.</b>

  
   <p><i>You need data to answer your research questions. Some groups in the collaboration have detectors and collect data for everyone. </i></p>

<p>Scientific research is <b>iterative</b> As you "figure it out," you will circle around the loop more than once to refine your analyses.</p>
  
  
  <p><b>If you have a detector, read on.</b> If not, you are ready to learn how to use the analysis tools you have selected for your research.</P> 
 
  <p><i> You will 
  set up your hardware to collect data. Then you will upload data files to a
  central server so they are available to
  everyone.</i></p>
