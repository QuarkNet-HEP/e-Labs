  <b>Milestone: Describe cosmic rays in simple terms.</b>

  <p><i>Scientific research involves observing nature to learn new facts or test applications of theories to known facts. Scientists write a proposal to get support for their reseach projects.</i></p>
  
 <p>You live in a continuous shower of cosmic ray muons. What are they? Where do they come from? Where do they get all that energy? Some background reading will tell you what we know.</p>

<p><a href="javascript:showRefLink('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_rays',750,600)">Wikipedia</a> is a good place to start.</p>

<p>As you begin your research, you should get used to keeping daily notes in a logbook. Check to see if you should be using our <b>e-Logbook</b>.</p>
  
  <p style="margin-left: 10px"><a href=
  "javascript:showRefLink('http://ed.fnal.gov/pdf/leo.pdf',600,720)">Leo's Logbook</a> - Scientific logbooks are bound so that the pages cannot be lost or removed. The pages are numbered also, so that if the book is photocopied, it is easy to reassemble the copies in the right order. The paper is of high quality so that this record will last for many years. There have actually been cases where patent rights of considerable commercial value have been assigned in court on the basis of logbook records.</p>

  <p>Now, write your own description of cosmic rays in your logbook.<br></p>
