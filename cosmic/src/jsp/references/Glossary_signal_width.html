The <b>signal width</b>, (sometimes called <b>time over threshold</b>), is the total time the signal is "over" a pre-defined threshold value. <br>
This graph shows the signal at zero for 3 nanoseconds and then it rapidly goes to about 5.5 <i>negative</i> units. The threshold is  at 2.5 <i>negative</i> units. The moment that the signal crosses the threshold, the electronics begin to measure it. While -5.5 <i>is certainly smaller</i> than -2.5, physics jargon still calls this "over threshold."<BR><IMG SRC="../graphics/pulse.gif">
