GPS Coordinates</a> - A geographic coordinate system is a coordinate system that 
enables every location on the Earth to be specified by a set of numbers, letters, 
or symbols.  A common choice of coordinates involve latitude and longitude.<br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude" target="_blank">
Latitude</a> is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north/south position of a point 
on the Earth's surface. It is an angle which ranges from 0 degrees at the Equator 
to 90 degrees (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, 
run east/west as circles parallel to the equator. <br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude" target="_blank">
Longitude</a> is a geographic coordinate that specifies the east/west position of a point 
on the Earth's surface. By convention, one of these, the Prime Meridian, which passes 
through the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, England, was allocated the position of zero 
degrees longitude. The longitude of other places is measured as the angle east or west 
from the Prime Meridian.
