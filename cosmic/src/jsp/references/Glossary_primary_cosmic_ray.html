An energetic particle, usually a proton or heavier nucleus, that is created in stellar processes and travels through space. These can collide with air molecules in Earth's upper atmosphere. The collisions create new, short-lived particles that continue to move toward Earth. These secondaries can also decay into particles; some (e.g., muons) live long enough to reach Earth's surface.
