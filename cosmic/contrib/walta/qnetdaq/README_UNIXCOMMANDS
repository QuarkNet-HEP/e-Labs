Again, the convention I use here is that the leading > in each command
example substitutes for the command prompt and you don't have to type it.
if you see
> ls -l
when you type it at the command line you only press the keys for "ls -l"
press return, and it looks like this
[waltadaq@lisa daqcode]$ ls -l
Beware, there is another use of > which redirects things to a file!


here are the relevant commands you can use.  You probably know several of
these, but I'll string some together in a useful way.
ls      list contents of the directory
ls -l   the -l (that is a lower case L) lists with date information also.
cd      change directory, as in cd daqcode/log
cd ..   move up one directory (from daqcode/log to daqcode)
more    prints out a text file one page at a time
less    (less is more) prints out a text file and you can use arrows to
        scroll through it.  less is better for examining daq card files.
cat     prints out a text file in one big long dump.
grep    the text searching tool.
|       the redirect pipe to another command.
>       the redirect to a file.  (note, not the command prompt!)
control-c is your friend.
when using both less and more, the "q" will also quit.
wc      does a line count, word count, and character count.

pico    my favorite terminal-based editor program, identical to what is
        used by pine.  Of course, emacs and vi are available too.

So, you might want to try things like this:  cat a file and pipe itto grep.
> cat onroof20030118_000.log | grep "channel 1"

and it will print out every line with the string "channel 1" and you can
see the singles rate change.

Too many to look at?  
> cat onroof20030118_000.log | grep "channel 1" | less
and use the arrows to scroll through it.

there will be many files, you can look at them all in sequence, or just
a subset of them.  Use wildcards.

> cat onroof*.log | grep "channel 1"

Since they are just text files, and you know excel, you could make one of
the histograms you wanted.  Here is the command that would do it.
> cat onroof*.log | grep "channel 1" > mysafefilename.txt


this types out all the files, choose only lines with "channel 1" in them, 
and then dumps that output to a file you called mysafefilename.txt
now mysafefilename is a text file with every word separated by a space 
that you can import into excel.

now copy that to your home computer with excel on it.
You could use a command like scp (secure copy): 
(don't forget the colon at the end!!!)
> scp mysafefilename.txt paul@hostname.washington.edu:
