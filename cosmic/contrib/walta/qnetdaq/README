Hello.  This is a command-line based DAQ program for Linux.
It works pretty well, is scriptable, and can be run remotely
without using a VNC viewer -- all you need is an ssh terminal.
It is suitable for long term data acquisition.
It tracks a small number of data parameters for you, but you
will want to run a more serious program on the final output
file.

The options you are likely to want are given on the command line.
The best way to run this is to figure out what settings you
need and make a script to set them all.  See the two examples
standardrun.sh and muontelescope.sh.  

If you want a nice GUI interface, we have also produced a 
LabView based DAQ program.  Some other people out there have
a Java based program as well.


The DAQ code.  What is here.

Note, the things here are not idiot proof,
and are probably not idiot resistant.  Use with caution.

The executable is daq.exe
And there is a captains.log to record changes, comments, configurations,
 and run start/stop things.

A shell script called isitrunning.exe 
There is a Makefile for building the executable
The directory data/ contains the raw data
The directory log/ contains log files of some verbosity
The README_DAQEXE files contain instructions on how to restart daq.exe
A sample script "standardrun.sh" that you can modify and run simply.
Other readme files contain useful information about formatting and some
 unix commands that are useful.

The easiest way to monitor what is going on, for now, is to 
grep lines out of the data files.

I hope someone (me?) will try to reimplement the proper runsummary.
