Here is the format of the information in the log files.

Note, in this version, the log file is temporarily turned off, because the
actual useful pieces of it are not re-implemented.

===============================================================================
every so often, I look at the singles rates.  
Here is what I print out when that happens.
Try using the command
> cat log/*.log | grep "delta time"

delta time 537 195 215116.400000 214801.411000 214219.430000 events so far 300

This is, in order:
the time difference between the current event and the first event in the file.
the time difference between the current event that the last time I did a singles check.
the utc time of the current event, 
the utc time of the "mark" event, the last time I checked the singles
and the utc time of the first event in the file.


===============================================================================
The singles rate information
Try using the command
> cat log/* | grep channel
or 
> cat log/* | grep "channel 2"

channel 0 hits 269514 rate (file) 323.546 (mark) 319.838 time 3443.846
channel 1 hits 847159 rate (file) 1016.998 (mark) 1004.710 time 3443.846
channel 2 hits 334834 rate (file) 401.962 (mark) 399.586 time 3443.846
channel 3 hits 540426 rate (file) 648.771 (mark) 644.895 time 3443.846
channel 4 hits 508 rate (file) 0.610 (mark) 0.650 time 3443.846

the hits number is the raw number of hits since the beginning of the file
the rate (file) is since I started this file
the rate (mark) is since the last time I checked singles
the time is utc time of the current event in hhmmss. format.
channels 0 through 3 are the singles rates for the four pieces of scintillator.
channel 4 is the counter for the preset coincidence level, 
          usually two or more scintillator.

There are glitches to this that cause spurious output for these values,
but they disappear, and affect only the read out, not the operation.

A similar glitch causes this data to not appear at all on schedule..
Again, it will appear later, and all will be fine.


===============================================================================
The hit patterns and other histogram informationhittag histogram 
Try using the commands
> cat log/* | grep "hittag"
or 
> cat log/* | grep "coincidences"


hittag histogram 0 7 13 80 2 36 99 9 5 39 133 6 54 3 8 6 
just a numerical histogram of the hittags, like the one Graham put in labview

coincidences 55 981 50 14
the number of 1-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, and 4-fold coincidences.
