This is mentioned in the README_OPTIONS but it is important.

The card is hard-coded to use a particular serial port baudrate.
We (at UW) found it necessary to hard-code a higher value.
But now there are DAQ cards in our lab with different baudrates!
I think the default is 19200 and we usually use 38400.

I am not an expert at serial port programming, but I have found
that if you pass the wrong baudrate to your card, it might lock
up the serial port.

In this case, go into daqcode.cc and find the lines

    fd = open(MODEMDEVICE, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY );
    //    fd = open(MODEMDEVICE, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NONBLOCK );

switch which one is commented (so O_NONBLOCK is active)
recompile.
run it.  It will segfault.
switch them back.
recompile.
run, but remember to give it the correct baudrate this time.

It would be nice if someone could show me how to unblock a bad
serial port using a simpler method, and include it here.
