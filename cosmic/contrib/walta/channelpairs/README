make this with a simple make command.
make

run this, for example:
channelpairs.exe ../sampledata/uwatmos_20040908_000.txt > channelpairs.exe

then look at the result either by inspecting the raw histograms, 
or using this script from the program rood by R. Brun et al.
root root-channelpairs.C

I have included a special version of channelpairs.txt that uses 
about one month worth of our data, not just the one samplefile.
