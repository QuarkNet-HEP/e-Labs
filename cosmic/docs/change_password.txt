Following this guide will enable you to change the password for any user in our user database.  For the purpose of example, let's assume that we want to change the password of the user fermigroup.

Login to the production machine (blacknuss.uchicago.edu).

Execute the iteractive PostreSQL client by typing /export/d2/pgsql/bin/psql at the command prompt.  You will be logged in as your Unix username on the machine.  If this command fails, please let Eric know and he can create a login for you.

After successful log in to the PostgreSQL database, you will be presented with a prompt that looks like this:

    egilbert=# 

Next you will need to connect to the most recent user database.  In this instance, the command is

    egilbert=# \c userdb8084_2004_0809 

To see all of the information about our users (name, password, upload permissions, etc.), execute

    egilbert=# select * from research_group;

Following our example, if you want to change the password for the user fermigroup, then you will need to update the research_group table with the command

    egilbert=# update research_group set password = 'blahblah' where name = 'fermigroup'; 


That's it.  Now you have changed the password for a user.  Happy editing!
