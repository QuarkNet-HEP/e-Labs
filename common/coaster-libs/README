These are coaster libraries and should not be changed. 

They are automatically downloaded  on a remote site when starting a
coaster service. Security  requires that these be checksummed, which is
a process done by the swift/cog build system, so simply replacing
jar files in this directory will probably cause errors when 
a coaster service is started.
