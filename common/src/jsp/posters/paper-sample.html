			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>We grabbed the data from the WALTA telescope stand (19 August 2003) and probed it carefully for possible decays and their lifetime. We present the analysis and results of the study.</p>
			
			<h2>Methods and Materials</h2>
			<p>The detector was arranged in a muon telescope. This consisted of 3, 60x60 cm counters in channels 1,2,4 top to bottom, with the daq card set for:<br>

 coincidences in channels 1,2 <br>

veto in 4<br>

10 microsecond gate width. <br>

(see the comments on the data file for this detail.) <br>

<br>We expected the trigger to collect charged particles that traversed the first two counters. Some of these decay, and one of the products is another charged particle. We looked for the amount of time betwen the arrival of the first particle and the observationl of the second. 



Our important analysis parameters were:<br>

Coincidence level: 2<br>

Check energy of 2nd pulse: No<br>

Gate width: 1 e-4 seconds<br>

Number of Bins: 60<br>

X-min of fit: 0.01<br>

X-max of fit: 200<br>

Fit the first two parameters (Y-intercept and Lifetime) with the following initial guesses:<br>

Alpha: 494<br>

Lifetime: 2.0<br>

Background: 0.5<br></p>
			
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>We observed nearly 1000 candidate decays. The particle in our detector has a lifetime of 2.84089 +/- 0.06827  microseconds. We suspect that it is a muon, but want to collect more data before an announcement.<br>

			<h2>Discussion and Conclusions</h2>
			<p>The lifetime of the particle in the detector strongly indicates that it is a muon. Some of the muons do not have enough energy to travel through the counter. Those that do not, stop and then at decay into electrons (or positrons) and a pair of neutrinos. The entering muon creates a PMT pulse, and the charged decay product (electron or positron) creates the second pulse. Bins of time between pulses indicate a predominance of times that fit an exponential with decay constant of  2.84089 +/- 0.06827microseconds. This closely matches the muon's lifetime.<br>



We will continue looking for data to confirm or refute our finding in this preliminary study.</p>
