Calibration studies include plateauing the counters, threshold selection and barometer calibration. <P>In addition, the QuarkNet online analysis tools include a "system performance" study for uploaded data. <B>Most</B> uploaded data will be checked automatically. However, your teacher may ask you to check your own.<P>  <B>Flux Experiments</B><BR>  You can do a variety of experiments investigating such things as cosmic ray  <A HREF="javascript:glossary('flux')">flux</A> as a function of time of day, solar activity, angle from vertical, barometric pressure, altitude. The list goes on. This can be an exciting set of experiments where <B>you</B> determine factors you want to test.<P> <B>Muon Lifetime Experiment</B><BR>  You can find the muon "lifetime." (Lifetime is one of many characteristics that allow us to describe particles. Others include mass and electric charge.) Some cosmic rays reach earth's surface in the form of muons. These short-lived particles may stop in the detector, wait around a while and then decay into an electron and two neutrinos. <P>  <B>Muon Lifetime Experiment to Verify Time Dilation</B><BR> A classic modern physics experiment to verify time dilation is the measurement of the muon mean lifetime. Since nearly all of the cosmic ray muons are created in the upper part of the atmosphere (>>30 km above the earth's surface), the time of flight for these muons as they travel to earth should be at least 100 ms. This assumes that muons are traveling at the speed of light - anything slower would require even more time. If you determine the muon lifetime that it is significantly less than this time, you are presented with the wonderful dilemma that the muon's time of flight is longer than its lifetime!<P> This time dilation "proof" assumes that all muons are created in the upper atmosphere. Although this is actually a good approximation, you cannot test it. However, by using the mean lifetime value and by measuring flux rates at two significantly different elevations, you can develop experimental proof for time dilation. This experiment requires you to have access to a mountain, an airplane, or collaboration with a team from another school that is at a significantly different altitude! Here is a wonderful opportunity for you to work together proving time dilation. <P> <B>Shower Studies</B><BR> With the GPS device connected to your DAQ board, the absolute time stamp allows a network of detectors (at the same site or at different schools) to study cosmic ray showers. You can look for small showers or collaborate with other schools in your area to look for larger showers.<P> The online analysis tools allow you to not only look for showers but to calculate the direction from which the shower (and thus the primary cosmic ray) originated.</FONT><P>Need more information on the possible studies?
