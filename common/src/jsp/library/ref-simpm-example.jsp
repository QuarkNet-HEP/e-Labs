Most meter sticks have spacing of 1 mm.  Thus, the closest you can measure is to the nearest single millimeter, and then you can estimate to a 1/10th of a millimeter (if you're good!).  For discussion sake, the "zero" end of the meter stick is broken off (Uh, oh!).<BR>  No worries.<p><b>Follow this simple example:</b><BLOCKQUOTE>To find the width of your desk, place the meter stick along the front of the desk, letting the broken end extend beyond the left edge.  This forces you to choose a starting number (because "zero" is not available).  Read the meter stick at this point, say:<BR> <img src="../graphics/meter-stick-desk.gif" border="1"><br>W<SUB>left</SUB> = 152 mm.  <BR>You read the right dimension as W<SUB>right</SUB> = 816 mm.  <BR>Obviously,<BR> W<SUB>desk</SUB> = W<SUB>right</SUB> - W<SUB>left</SUB><BR> W<SUB>desk</SUB> = 816 mm - 152 mm<BR> W<SUB>desk</SUB> = 664 mm<BR> Repeat to verify your numbers recording each trial.<BR><B>They may not be the same each time!</B><BR> Similarly, you find the length to be L<SUB>desk</SUB> = 561 mm<BR> This trivial case demonstrates each facet of taking measurements using:<UL> <LI>Fundamental units - length <LI>Measurement system - SI (also called metric)<LI>Instrument - meter stick<LI>Calibration - Find the "zero" point, W<sub>left</sub> = 152 mm.<LI>Taking measurements and recording the numbers - log book/data table (You did write down the data, didn't you?)<LI>Errors - Repeat until confident of numbers.</UL></BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right"><HR><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</FONT></A></td></tr></table></BODY></HTML>
