<P><b>A Proper Plot:</b><p> What are the necessary characteristics of an understandable plot or graph? Let's look at the standard format of an X-Y plot.</p>

<p><b>Title/Key:</B>
    <UL>
    <LI> Each plot must include a descriptive title making the plot stand alone.  Do not use simple scale names in the title; e.g., "Distance vs Time."
    <LI> Provide a key connecting a description to the symbols and curves used in the plot.  Include any relevant variables and values that remain constant for the entire plot.
    </UL>
    
 <b>Scales:</b>
    <UL>
    <LI> Plot the independent variable&mdash;functional variable used as input into experiment or calculations&mdash;on the "X" axis.
    <LI> Plot the dependent variable&mdash;functional output of experiment or calculation&mdash;on the "Y" axis.
    <LI> Recess the scales in from the grid edge.
    <LI> Scale the grid spacing 1, 2, 5, or 10 squares <b>only</b>.  Do not use unusual or irregular grid spacing such as 3 or 4 spaces, which make data hard to plot and decipher.
    <LI> Write scale titles outside the scales and facing down for the "X" axis and toward the "Y" axis.  Include: name of the scale, symbol (which matches the report equations), units in parentheses; e.g., Distance, x, (m).
    <LI> Choose scale spacing and range to distribute data evenly over the grid.  Do not squeeze data to one side of the plot.
    </UL>

<P>
<b>Actual (Measured) Data:</b>
    <UL>
    <LI> Represent actual data points by symbols: <IMG SRC="../graphics/box.gif">, <IMG SRC="../graphics/Delta.gif">,  <IMG SRC="../graphics/diamond.gif">, <IMG SRC="../graphics/circ.gif">, etc. Each different symbol indicates a different independent variable.  When data points fall near each other, stack the symbols.
    <LI> You may connect data points with straight lines to help you follow the data.  Do not imply data which do not exist by drawing a "smooth" curve through data points.
    </UL>

<b>Theoretical (Predicted) Data:</b>
    <UL>
    <LI> Represent theoretical data by continuous lines
which represent continuous validity, unlike the separate measured data points.
	<LI> Theoretical curves may be derived from a mathematical, analytic model or a "best fit" representation.
    
    </UL>
