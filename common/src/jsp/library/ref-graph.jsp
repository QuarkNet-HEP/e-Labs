Graphs and plots comprise the scientist's prime means to compactly communicate their data and theory usually in the form of an X-Y plot.  Let's look at the standard format of an X-Y plot.</I>
<P>
<b>A PROPER PLOT - Necessary characteristics of an understandable plot</b>
<P>
<b>TITLE/KEY</B>
    <UL>
    <LI> Each plot must include a descriptive title making the plot stand alone.  Do not use simple scale names in the title; e.g., "Distance vs Time".
    <LI> Provide a key connecting a description to the symbols and curves used in the plot.  Include any relevant variables and values that remain constant for the entire plot.
    </UL>
    
 <b>SCALES</b>
    <UL>
    <LI> Independent variable - functional variable used as input into experiment or calculations.  Plotted on the "X" axis.
    <LI> Dependent variable - functional output of experiment or calculation.  Plotted on the "Y" axis.
    <LI> Recess the scales in from the grid edge.
    <LI> Scale grid spacing: 1, 2, 5, or 10 squares <u>only</u>.  Do not use strange or irregular grid spacing such as 3 or 4 spaces which make data hard to plot and decipher.
    <LI> Scale titles - written exterior to the scales and facing down for the "X" axis and toward the "Y" axis.  Include: name of the scale, symbol (which matches the report equations), units in parentheses; e.g., Distance, x, (m)
    <LI> Scale lengths - choose spacing and range to distribute data evenly over the grid.  Do not squeeze data to one side of the plot.
    </UL>

<P>
<b>ACTUAL (MEASURED) DATA</b>
    <UL>
    <LI> Plotted data points marked by symbol point protectors: <IMG SRC="graphics/box.gif">, <IMG SRC="graphics/Delta.gif">,  <IMG SRC="graphics/diamond.gif">, <IMG SRC="graphics/circ.gif">, etc. Each different symbol indicates an alternate, independent variable.  When data points fall near each other, stack symbols; do not overdraw.
    <LI> Data points are connected by straight lines for relational reference only.  Do not imply data which do not exist by drawing a "smooth" curve through data points.  Reserve continuous curves for theoretical (predicted) data.  Use superscripts on data symbols for special notes.
    </UL>

<b>THEORETICAL (PREDICTED) DATA</b>
    <UL>
    <LI> Represent theoretical data by solid or dashed lines that are drawn as continuous, e.g., <BR>
a) ------------, b) - - - - - - -, c) --- - --- - --- - ---  <BR>
which represents continuous validity (continuous function) unlike measured data points which only have "local" validity.
	<LI> Theoretical curves may be derived from a mathematical, analytic model or from a "best fit" representation.
    <LI> Label the theoretical curves with a bent, graphic arrow to label and identify. 
    </UL>
