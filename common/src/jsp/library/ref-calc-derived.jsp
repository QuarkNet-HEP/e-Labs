Thus, length and time are fundamental; velocity is derived.  <P>Suppose, using the example of your <a href="javascript:openPopup('ref-simpm-example.jsp',600,600)"><b>desktop</b></a>, you want to find the area of your desktop.  Without an "area-o-meter" (Can you imagine such an instrument?), you must calculate the area using the length and width measurements.  So simply, <P STYLE="margin-left: 10px">Area = Length x Width.  <P>You have built a new, derived quantity from fundamental quantities.<P><P><A HREF="javascript:openPopup('ref-calc-example.jsp',600,600)"><b>Extended Example</b></A> - Calculate area, rate and flux.</TD></TR><P></TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right"><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</FONT></A></td></tr></table>   </body></html>
