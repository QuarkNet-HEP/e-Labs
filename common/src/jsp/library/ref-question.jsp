The goal,at first, is to capture as many ideas as possible. Choose a recorder and let your ideas flow without comment.<P><LI>Examine your list. Select overriding issues that draw together concepts for your study. Organize your ideas. Prioritize your ideas. Focus on centralizing theme to help you compose an "essential question" or maybe two.<P>Make sure these are not topical questions.  For example, the question, "What was the American Revolution?" lacks the sophistication of  "Why did the American Revolution occur?"  One regurgitates facts; the other requires thought, analysis and research.  <P><LI>Review your questions. Is your question too narrow or too broad? Which is most meaningful to you? Which seems most doable considering resources you have available? In your search for a high-level question, you need to be comfortable with ambiguity.  The process of deriving this question could be, probably is, a messy process.<P><LI>Be ready to receive feedback from teammates, your teacher and experts. You may not reach closure quickly.  Iterate!  Repeat the process, and gather more information.  Let the question evolve into a robust research question.  The best questions will not be given to you; they grow from self-discovery.</UL></TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right"><HR><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</A></td></tr></table></BODY></HTML>
