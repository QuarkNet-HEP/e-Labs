Here's a good example:</p> <p>How does the length of a wire affect that wire's electrical resistance?</p>    <p><b>Tips:</b></p>  <UL><LI>Review your background information and brainstorm ideas for a research study.  The goal, at first, is to develop as many ideas as possible. Choose a recorder and let your ideas flow without comment.<P><LI>Examine your list. Select overriding issues that draw together concepts for your study. Organize your ideas. Prioritize your ideas. Focus on a centralizing theme to help you compose an "essential question" or maybe two.<P>Make sure these are not topical questions.  For example, the question, "What was the American Revolution?" lacks the sophistication of  "Why did the American Revolution occur?"  One regurgitates facts; the other requires thought, analysis and research.  <P><LI>Review your questions. Is your question too narrow or too broad? Which is most meaningful to you? Which seems most doable considering resources you have available? In your search for a high-level question, you need to be comfortable with ambiguity.  The process of deriving this question could be, probably is, a messy process.<P><LI>Be ready to receive feedback from teammates, your teacher and experts. You may not reach closure quickly.  Iterate!  Repeat the process, and gather more information.  Let the question evolve into a robust research question.  The best questions will not be given to you; they grow from self-discovery.</UL></TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right"><HR><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</A></td></tr></table></BODY></HTML>
