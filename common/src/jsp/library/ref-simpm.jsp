Measuring involves:<UL><LI><B>Choosing measurement system:</B> <BR>For example, meters or feet (SI or English).<P>Scientists use SI. Within the SI system some fundamental units are: length (m), mass (kg), time (s). Another fundamental measurement occurs in all systems: counting the number of events, for example, how many raindrops fell at school yesterday but has no units.  <P><LI><B>Using measuring instruments:</B> <BR>Choose appropriate instruments or tools. For example, you can't measure length with a thermometer.  (Da!)<P>Make sure you know how to read the numbers on the instrument.<P>Calibrate the instrument (zero point).  You've got to know the starting point to take a measurement. <P><LI><B>Taking measurements and logging numbers on raw data table:</B>  <BR>Reading the instrument takes practice and an understanding of the mechanics of the instrument.  <P>Set up a data table.<P>Record fundamental data as you take it. Don't try to remember for later; that's when mistakes are made and data lost.  <P><LI><B>Assessing the errors in the measurements: </B> <br><B>Every measurement ever taken contains errors.</B><BR> Consideration of error may affect the instrument you choose. Measuring the thickness of a piece of paper with a meter stick would cause huge errors; using a micrometer enables more refined data.<P><LI><B>Determining the accuracy and precision of measurements:</B>   <BR>Knowing if a measurement is accurate requires knowing  a realistic range for the correct answer before you take data.  Theory and modeling come into play.  With theory, you make a prediction of what the "correct" measurement will be.  This could be thought of as a hypothesis.</UL><P>	<a href="javascript:openPopup('ref-simpm-example.jsp',600,600)"><b>An Example</b></a> - Measuring a desk</TD></TR>   <tr><td align="right"><HR><A HREF="javascript:window.close();">Close Window</FONT></A></td></tr></table></BODY></HTML>
