  <b>Milestone: Use the e-Lab to discuss your results.</b>

  <p><i>Communication is a two-way street. Scientists present results;
  other scientists ask tough questions. This exchange can confirm
 results, or it may identify gaps in an analysis and
  suggest ways to improve the research. Wide acceptance of the
  work means that scientists have satisfied their collegaues.</i></p>
