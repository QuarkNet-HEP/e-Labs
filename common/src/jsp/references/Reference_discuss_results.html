  <b>Milestone: Use the e-Lab to discuss your results.</b>

  <p><i>Communication is a two-way street. Scientists present results;
  other scientists ask tough questions. This exchange can confirm

  suggest ways to improve the research. Wide acceptance of the
  work means that scientists have satisfied their colleagues.</i></p>
