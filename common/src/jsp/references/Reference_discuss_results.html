<b>Milestone: Use the e-Lab to discuss your results.</b><P>     <I>    Communication is a two-way street. You present results; your audience asks tough questions. This exchange can confirm your results, or it may identify gaps in your analysis and suggest ways to improve your research. Wide acceptance of your ideas means that you have satisfied your critics. <P> You ask questions of other student research teams, leave comments on posters, and respond to those left on your posters. This respectful back and forth discussion is DOING SCIENCE. </I>      <P><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../jsp/logEntry.jsp?keyword=discuss_results',700,600)"><b>Log it!</b><IMG SRC="graphics/logbook_pencil.gif" border="0"  align="middle"></A>   <P> <B>References</B> <p>     <P STYLE="margin-left: 10px"><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('../library/comments-poster-static.html',950,600)">Example Comment Page</a> - comments gathered from many teams<br>      <P STYLE="margin-left: 10px"><A HREF="javascript:showRefLink('http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/gravity_speed_030116.html',800,600)">Science At Odds</a> - example of when science requires public discourse among experts to advance<br>
