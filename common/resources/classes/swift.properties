# The IP address of the submit machine is used by GRAM as a callback
# address to report the status of submitted jobs. In general, Swift
# can automatically detect the IP address of the local machine. 
# However, if the machine has more than one network interface, Swift
# will pick the first one, which may not be the right choice. It is
# recommended that this property is set properly before attempting to
# run jobs through GRAM.
# Format:
#    ip.address=x.y.z.w
#

#ip.address=127.0.0.1

#
# false	- means an error will be immediately reported and cause the
# 		workflow to abort. At this time remote jobs that are already
#		running will not be canceled
# true	- means that Swift will try to do as much work as possible and 
#		report all errors encountered at the end. However, "errors"
#		here only applies to job execution errors. Certain errors
#		that are related to the Swift implementation (should such 
#		errors occur) will still be reported eagerly.

# Default: true

# What algorithm to use for caching of remote files. LRU (as in what
# files to purge) is the only implementation right now. One can set
# a target size (in bytes) for a host by using the swift:storagesize 
# profile for a host in sites.xml
#
# Default: LRU
#
caching.algorithm=LRU

#
# true       - generate a provenance graph in .dot format (Swift will
#			 choose a random file name)

#
# true	- clustering of small jobs is enabled. Clustering works in the 
#       following way: If a job is clusterable (meaning that it has the
#       GLOBUS::maxwalltime profile specified in tc.data and its value
#       is less than the value of the "clustering.min.time" property) it will
#       be put in a clustering queue. The queue is processed at intervals 
#       specified by the "clustering.queue.delay" property. The processing
#       of the clustering queue consists of selecting compatible jobs and
#		grouping them in clusters whose max wall time does not exceed twice
#       the value of the "clustering.min.time" property. Two or more jobs are 
#       considered compatible if they share the same site and do not have
#       conflicting profiles (e.g. different values for the same environment
#       variable). 
# false	- clustering of small jobs is disabled.
#
# Default: true
#
clustering.enabled=false

# Kickstart is a useful tool that can be used to gather various information
# about a remote process. Before it can be used it must be installed on the
# remote site and the corresponding entry be set in the sites file.
# This option allows controlling of how Swift uses Kickstart. The following
# values are possible:
# false - do not use Kickstart
# true  - use Kickstart. If a job is scheduled on a site that does not have
#       Kickstart installed, that job will fail.
# maybe - Use Kickstart if installed (i.e. the entry is present in the sites
#       file) 
#
# Default: maybe
#

kickstart.enabled=false

#
# Indicates when Kickstart records should be fetched from the remote site:
# true	- always transfer Kickstart records if Kickstart was used (see
#		kickstart.enabled)
# false	- only transfer Kickstart records if the job fails

# Default: false
#

# For the throttling parameters, valid values are either a positive integer
# or "off" (without the quotes).
#

#
# Limits the number of concurrent submissions for a workflow instance. This
# throttle only limits the number of concurrent tasks (jobs) that are being
# sent to sites, not the total number of concurrent jobs that can be run.
# The submission stage in GRAM is one of the most CPU expensive stages (due
# mostly to the mutual authentication and delegation). Having too many 
# concurrent submissions can overload either or both the submit host CPU
# and the remote host/head node causing degraded performance.     
#
# Default: 4
#

throttle.submit=4
#throttle.submit=off

#
# Limits the number of concurrent submissions for any of the sites Swift will
# try to send jobs to. In other words it guarantees that no more than the 
# value of this throttle jobs sent to any site will be concurrently in a state
# of being submitted.
#
# Default: 2
#

throttle.host.submit=4
#throttle.host.submit=off

#
# The Swift scheduler has the ability to limit the number of concurrent jobs
# allowed on a site based on the performance history of that site. Each site
# is assigned a score (initially 1), which can increase or decrease based
# on whether the site yields successful or faulty job runs. The score for a
# site can take values in the (0.1, 100) interval. The number of allowed jobs
# is calculated using the following formula: 
# 	2 + score*throttle.score.job.factor
# This means a site will always be allowed at least two concurrent jobs and
# at most 2 + 100*throttle.score.job.factor. With a default of 4 this means
# at least 2 jobs and at most 402.
#
# Default: 4
#

throttle.score.job.factor=4
#throttle.score.job.factor=off


#
# Limits the total number of concurrent file transfers that can happen at any
# given time. File transfers consume bandwidth. Too many concurrent transfers
# can cause the network to be overloaded preventing various other signalling
# traffic from flowing properly.
#
# Default: 4
#

throttle.transfers=8
#throttle.transfers=off

# Limits the total number of concurrent file operations that can happen at any
# given time. File operations (like transfers) require an exclusive connection
# to a site. These connections can be expensive to establish. A large number
# of concurrent file operations may cause Swift to attempt to establish many 
# such expensive connections to various sites. Limiting the number of concurrent
# file operations causes Swift to use a small number of cached connections and
# achieve better overall performance. 
# 
# Default: 8
#

throttle.file.operations=16
#throttle.file.operations=off

# Indicates whether the working directory on the remote site should be
# left intact even when the workflow completes successfully. This can be
# used to inspect the site working directory for debugging purposes.
#
# Default: false
