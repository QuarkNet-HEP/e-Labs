The Cosmic Ray e-Lab provides an opportunity for students to:
<UL>
<LI>Do authentic research to access, process and publish data, report and share their results as online posters, and have online discussions with one another about their work. 
<LI>Experience the environment of scientific collaborations. 
<LI>Possibly to make real contributions to a burgeoning scientific field.
</UL>
The project explores the potential of using the Internet and a new type of distributed computing called the Grid  in high school physics classes. 
<P>
Schools with cosmic ray detectors upload data to a "virtual data grid" portal where ALL the data resides. This approach allows students to analyze a much larger body of data and to share analysis code. Also, it allows schools that do not have cosmic ray detectors to participate in research by analyzing shared data. 
<P>
The website provides a place for students to:
<UL>
<LI>Organize their research.
<LI>Access and analyze the cosmic ray data from schools around the country.
<LI>Write a poster to summarize their research.
<LI>Communicate with other school groups doing similar research. 
</UL>
<P>
Currently, the project is designed for physics students whose teachers are participating in one of several cosmic ray projects in North America. <A HREF="http://csr.phys.ualberta.ca/nalta/">NALTA</A>
<P>
However, we plan to build professional development into the teacher pages so that other physics teachers can join the collaboration.
<P>
 We also plan two levels of  data analysis: the science-based interface and a more advanced interface for students interested in learning about and working with the Grid environment. <B>STAY TUNED!</B>
